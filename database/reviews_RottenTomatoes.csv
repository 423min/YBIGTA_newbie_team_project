4.5,2026.01.17.,Me gusta esta pelicula por lo que representa y pues ya son varias veces que me la he visto.
4,2026.01.17.,Tokyo is a interesting movie that you get to watch is very cool. I gave you four stars because I couldn’t watch it fully.
0.5,2026.01.16.,"Zootopia is an animated movie that seems far more interested in making sure you understand its message than in trusting you to enjoy the story. From early on, the film’s allegory for racism is pushed so hard it stops being allegory and starts feeling like a checklist. Every conflict exists to reinforce the same point, and characters regularly pause the momentum to restate the moral in plain terms. There’s little room for subtext, ambiguity, or audience interpretation. If you somehow missed the message the first time, don’t worry—the movie will repeat it again, slower, and with emphasis. What’s frustrating is that the world-building and premise are genuinely clever. But instead of letting themes emerge naturally, the film insists on guiding your reaction at every step. By the second half, the messaging becomes so overt and self-satisfied that it actively hurts watchability. It’s not offensive. It’s exhausting. A movie that mistakes repetition for depth and sincerity for insight."
4.5,2026.01.13.,Has an impressive plotline and enjoyable for both older and younger audience.

5,2025.12.18.,"If like me you arent usually a huge fan of animated movies, i mean youll love this. Genuinely its written really well and most of the jokes land pretty good too."
4.5,2025.12.15.,Cute family friendly movie. Really entertaining.
4,2025.12.15.,Definitely a good movie. The story was well written in my opinion with some good twists and emotional beats. Some of the jokes weren't that funny though. Definitely recommend watching it with someone else because it makes it more fun
5,2025.12.13.,"The characters of the movie are amazing nd each character is amazing in its own way.LOVED THE MOVIE, i have watched it atleast 5 times now.The plot twists in this movie are mind blowing."
4,2025.12.12.,"Zootopia is a modern classic of Disney animation, packed with energetic visuals, incredible voice acting, and a world that feels instantly alive. Its world-building is clever and layered, supporting a genuinely engaging central mystery that keeps the story moving. The final villain is a bit underwhelming, keeping it just shy of Disney’s very best—but it’s absolutely worth the watch, and the Shakira song is an undeniable banger."
4,2025.12.12.,It's so entertaining and carries great messages. But the way it establishes the predator-prey conflict as bias still has some issues. There is stuff in it that is better not to think too much about in so many ways.
3.5,2025.12.11.,"Besides the ending, at least it's a watchable movie"
5,2025.12.10.,Love this movie. It’s so cute. Haven’t seen it since it first came out. I ship nick and Judy so hard.. 😬.
3.5,2025.12.09.,"The animation is gorgeous, charatcers are great, and there are legitimately moments. Some of the themes suck- a girlboss cop causes racism while also fixing it. The allegories are muddled and it bashed you over the head with copaganda. I mean really, being oversealous giving parking tickets is presented as a noble act in one scene. Hopps tricks a guy into tresspassing and then extorts him. She mentions ways of getting around the need for warants. It is charmning on the surface, but if you actually analyze the story, it is rotten at its core."
2,2025.12.08.,"I understand why this movie gets praised by everyone, but it is not for me. The story is kinda lame, the animation looks nothing special and some of the characters can be written better. There is a lot of praised about the theme of countering prejudices and stereotypes of animals because their are born with advantages and disadvantages, therefore it is something very unfounded as a theme using animals as metaphors. Most of the jokes didn't land and I like when Nick started to accept Judy, but I don't like the scene where Judy apologises to Nick, because it looked so ridiculous."
3.5,2025.12.08.,A rare case of liking the sequel over the original. May have felt differently on this if I had seen it first.
4,2025.12.08.,"It’s a bright, bustling movie with a surprisingly layered mystery tucked beneath all the animal gags. The animation is top-tier—every corner of the city feels alive, and every character move sells the comedy. And it is genuinely funny, the kind of humor that sneaks up on you while the story quietly builds something heartfelt. What really makes it sing is how it blends optimism, social bite, and pure charm without ever feeling heavy-handed. It’s a high Disney-Pixar-caliber film that knows exactly what it’s doing: entertaining you while saying something real. Smart, warm, witty—Zootopia earns its four stars with style."
4.5,2025.12.08.,"🏆93% Zootopia was probably my favorite Disney movie when it first came out, and it’s still my favorite even now. It’s definitely one of the more mature Disney films. It has some references to other movies and even some shows; there’s actually a reference to Breaking Bad in this, and I heard that in the second movie there will be even more references to other media than what this film has. Anyway, the best part of this movie is easily the dynamic between Nick and Judy. When I first watched the movie, I remember liking it because it was the first time a Disney movie actually shocked me with its twist villain, but it seems I completely forgot how good their dynamic was. I’m seeing Zootopia 2 tomorrow, I hope it’s at least almost as good as the first film!"
4,2025.12.08.,"Zootopia is a fast-paced fun animated film with some interesting nuanced themes. The characters are pretty well-written and a joy to watch. The dialogues and situations are funny. The themes are handled more maturely than I had initially expected, but they're still perfectly easy to handle for a child. The story is simple, but the twists are not too obvious and work well with the characters. The directing is good with a light-hearted tone. The cinematography is good enough and the pacing is great. The cast is good, but pretty weird, because when I heard a familiar voice, I couldn't place it. Zootopia is a lot of fun."
5,2025.12.07.,"This movie manages to represent the topic racism while also making an amazing movie for kids. The plot was perfectly written, not to mention the details in this films deserves more recognition, especially the infrastructure seen being used in the city Zootopia itself. Overall, a great movie to see with anyone, especially children."
5,2025.12.06.,"Truly a must see! Dare I say this is the best Disney sequal to be released in many years. Our kids have asked to see it again and I'd usually say we'll wait until the Disney+ release, but I'm happy to oblige them this time!"
5,2025.12.06.,I waited so long to see Nick and Judy have some progress in their relationship but the slow burn is healing me. I love Zootopia so much it's like watching a romcom
5,2025.12.06.,Great movie！I‘ve already seen it twice！
5,2025.12.06.,What a rare experience of a great sequel to a Disney Movie. I am very much looking forward to the next adventure of the two couples. Disney...Listen to your audience. This is a step forward.
5,2025.12.06.,A brilliant story about following your dreams.
4,2025.12.05.,清新可爱，喜欢那些不同的动物生活在一起的细节。
5,2025.12.05.,The movie is like a new world to explore. The story plot is worth for the audience.
5,2025.12.05.,"Se convirtió fácilmente en una de mis películas animadas favoritas. La animación es preciosa, los personajes son carismáticos y muy divertidos, los chistes realmente funcionan y la historia es entretenida, conmovedora y memorable. Es de esas películas que uno disfruta de principio a fin."
5,2025.12.05.,Great movie by Disney! Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin are fantastic together!
2,2025.12.04.,The plot is way worst than the first one. Suspense not strong enough at all. very disappointed.
5,2025.12.03.,"This movie is way deeper than it looks. Funny, emotional, and surprisingly real. You should watch it at least once."
3,2025.12.03.,"It's creative and well made, but it was a little too dark for me for some reason."
