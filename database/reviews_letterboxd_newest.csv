75/100.
This is a really nice animation movie, very animal friendly. It's cool to see how the city is organized and I wish the surroundings would've been more explored and explained. The city is fantastic. It has a couple of jokes that are good and made me laugh. Nice movie!

They’ve got a great world established here, and lots of tiny cool details in the backgrounds. We’ve got a very dynamic and fun duo with Judy and Nick. The themes of the movie are pretty in-your-face, but they’re also effective. Overall story and villain are a bit lackluster, but that doesn’t detract from the whole thing still being a fun adventure!

Every time I rewatch this with Jasper, I think “this can’t be as racist as I remember, I was probably being a crabby asshole,” but it’s that racist. You can’t follow the premise as a metaphor for people without immediately running into, like, “some races are naturally more vicious than others.”

Me gusta mucho esta película por lo diferente que es a las demás de Disney. Siento que destaca por ello. No solo tiene un worldbuilding mayor, con las distintas partes de la ciudad y otros lugares más que enseñan, si no también por la temática policiaca que sigue y el misterio tan interesante.
Como digo, la trama me parece muy buena, siguiendo un caso oscuro en el inicio de la carrera de la protagonista que no deja de ser una… more

Meh. Feel the messages in this film are a bit overt/ maybe not worth shoving down peoples throats. And not a fan of the gazelle/shakira song. Has some funny moments and interesting world creation.

Todas as soluções partem de locais lógicos que ja foram outrora apresentados no filme, tudo que é mostrado sera utilizado nada fica ""jogado"" ou sem sentido. Enfim, um ótimo filme, extremamente divertido e engraçado com toques de atualidade, recomendo extremamente.

I'm super late to the party here, but this is easily one of the best animated movies of the last 10 years. I'm really behind the ball when it comes to animation in recent years. I'm not sure how I've allowed that to happen because I love animated movies and find such comfort in so many of them, but I just haven't watched a ton of them. I've always thought about dedicating an entire month to specifically watching animated movies… more

La dynamique entre Nick et Judy est trop mignonne et ça tout le long du film et c’est vraiment le point fort du film. Que ce soit dans leur dialogue ou de la manière dont l’animation nous montre leurs émotions.
En plus de ça l’intrigue est bien et bien amené donc t’es intéressé et tu lâches pas et en terme d’animation ya rien a redire surtout pour un film d’il y a 10 ans.
Les références faites à d’autres Disney… more

I apologize for the short review, but I don't have much to say about Zootopia. It's a fun animated film with clever commentary, an entertaining story and a cute emotional core. The comedy mostly works, however the emotion doesn't hit as hard. It works for what it tries to be, but I wouldn't call it one of my favorites. The world we're in looks great and I would love to see more. Luckily, we have a sequel now, which I'll… more

Sem dúvida uma das melhores animações da Disney! Gostei muito de Zootopia e da forma como o filme lida com as diferenças e até mesmo com a discriminação, é de fato uma animação bem consciente.
Sobre o filme mesmo:
- Essa raposa é foda
- Essa cena do Poderoso Chefão é uma das coisas mais incríveis que já vi em animações kkkkk
-
🇬🇧🇺🇸 English:
Without a doubt one of Disney's best animations! I really enjoyed Zootopia and… more

Animation très belle, je m'attendais pas à voir une ref au Parrain, ça m’a bien fait rire, peut-être la seule scène avec celle des paresseux. Sinon l’humour dans ce film c’est vrmnt pas ma came. Ni l’histoire, ni les persos ne m’ont intéressé. Pas mon style de film, mais pas nul non plus.

Je n'avais jamais regardé zootopie, et ben c'est génial ! On se régale durant tout le film c'est super beau, c'est très bien animé et il y a énormément de références cachées qu'on se régale de repérer. Les personnages sont très attachant. Pour conclure je dirait que c'est peut-être l'un des meilleurs films d'animation à regarder en famille car tout le monde y trouve son compte.

Volví a ver ""Zootrópolis"" de cara a la secuela y me ha servido para recordar la gran película que hizo Disney sobre este ciudad de mamíferos y el misterio que la envuelve. La protagonista, una conejita agente de policía y su compañero como zorro astuto conforman un dúo cómico muy divertido y que se ha convertido en uno de los mas reconocibles de la franquicia.
Una película llena de ingenio, con personajes entrañables y con diálogos muy ocurrentes. Los estereotipos… more

Un Disney malin qui enchaîne les blagues tout en glissant des messages bien sentis sur les préjugés et l’égalité. La scène des paresseux mérite à elle seule le prix du meilleur timing comique.
Moralité : à Zootopie, comme ailleurs, se fier aux apparences est la pire des enquêtes !

Watched with my kid. Coming off the sequel, this had a lot more originality than I was expecting. The chase that moves into the tiny town is kind of an all-timer of animation. The scene in the nudist colony is one of the most baffling things I've ever seen. It sends my mind whirling and now I have to consider if maybe all these animals neuter themselves for the sake of coexistence and harmony. For reasons I can't explain it manages to be one of the less horny talking animal movies I've seen.

Uma aula de como fazer uma animação para todos! Agrada os pequenos com suas cores, cenas divertidas e personagens carismáticos e fofos. E para os adultos temos um mundo criativo e inventivo, que serve de palco para uma história sobre preconceitos e o poder da amizade e parceria. E dentro de tudo isso ainda sobra espaço para um intrigante filme de investigação. Um jovem clássico Disney!

Idk what is the weirdest thing this movie got me thinking about after watch. The multiple amount of questions I had for this world about how sex works for them, or the fact Bellwether feels like she was a foreshadow on Kristi Noem.
This was a good movie tho, a true simple classic from 2010s Disney.

영화 <주토피아>는 무대 위, 연극으로 시작한다. 연극을 통해 주토피아가 어떤 곳인지를 관객에게 영리하게 전달한다. 연극의 내용을 한 단어로 요약하자면, 주토피아는 곧 유토피아라고 해석할 수 있겠다. 모두가 평화롭게 화합하는 천국.
그리고 이어지는 장면을 통해, 관객은 주디의 힘찬 포부를 통해, 주디의 꿈과 소망이 무엇인지 알게 된다. 관객은 그때부터 주토피아는 곧 “꿈의 공장인 헐리우드”라고 유추할 수 있게 된다. 꿈과 환상이 이루어지는 곳. 아니 꿈과 환상을 파는 곳. 헐리우드, 그리고 “디즈니”.
주디의 원대한 계획은 드디어 현실이 된다. 그녀의 피나는 노력과 집념은 드디어 그녀가 그토록… more

There's never been a rabbit on the cosmopolitan Zootopia city police force, but Judy Hopps has three big advantages - supreme agility, quick thinking, and a never-say-die attitude. Graduating at the top of her academy class, and with a little help from the mayor's request to increase diversity on the force, Judy becomes their latest recruit. But Chief Bogo, who isn't impressed by anything, is even less impressed by a rabbit on the force, and has Judy on parking ticket… more

Toujours un plaisir de regarder ce dessisn animé. Je trouve que les détails pour rendre l'environnement adapté à tous les animaux sont fous ! La palette de couleurs pète et rend heureux, les voix associés sont juste et parfois hilarantes !
L'histoire permet de croire en ses rêves et de ne jamais abandonner, même quand on est au plus loin de ses objectifs. Quand on veut vraiment et qu'on se donne les moyens, on réussi forcément à faire des grandes choses et à réaliser ses rêves !
J'ai pas chialée mais j'étais vraiment bien dedans !

I mean there's hardly anything new.. in terms of story.
But the references..!! They nailed it on those.
Also the use of metaphors and parallels with real world.. is what made it this good film.
One particular emotional scene (for me).. (I didn't cry) and there were several moments to have a good laugh.
It's short but it definitely took time to get going.. and yes there were few okayish scenes in terms of logic.
Overall a solid animated film. Looking forward to watch Part 2.

I’m not in love with this story, but the jokes are sharp, and I was really impressed with how packed full of life this world is! Every new neighborhood was teeming with details I wanted to know more about. I got the sense that the people who made this movie had a backstory in mind for every character who entered the frame. My kids loved it and we’re all excited to see the second one. Judy and Nick should quit being cops and just become full time popsicle hustlers, though.

Okay, this movie is great. It shows the ability that ""small"" people can be bigger, and not in the sense of height, but of capacity. I LOVE this movie of passion, it reminds me of my childhood. The animal world is super well done; the case is well directed. Nick's sarcasm makes the movie funny, I love it!!

Bem legal a quantidade de pautas importantes que o filme levanta. 
Mas ainda assim pra mim é um filme muito infantilizado, o que de certa forma não é ruim, mas pro meu gosto pessoal… acho que prefiro assistir animações com um pouco mais de profundidade e peso, mesmo com uma animação leve… deu pra entender… um exemplo de um filme que usa bem isso “Robot Dreams”.

Mannn, that Godfather reference and Breaking Bad killed me 🤣🤣😂 Especially after just watching The Godfather Part II. I really didn’t expect such a clever Easter egg scene. Honestly I didn’t plan on watching these back to back and had no idea about the scene, but I’m glad I did. Also, the well known Flash scene is brilliantttttt.

This movie is really great and has surprisingly emotional dialogue and performances. The landscapes and world building of Zootopia are crazy; when Judy first enters the city on the train, I had my eyes glued to all of the amazing scenery in the background. Just like how the city of Zootopia is full of variety, the movie is full of several different scenes that all succeed in conveying their intended effect: funny, sad, frightening, and action-packed. Story is great and heartwarming; lots of humor that is tailored to adults as well. All of the animal puns are cheesy but appreciated.

In Brief:
I saw a review of this film once upon a time that called it “Crash for children.” I haven’t seen Crash so I cannot quantify that statement myself; but a poor attempt at discussing racism? Yeah, that’s kinda accurate. It’s a better detective film, and would have been a great one if it was only that.
At Length:
So, time to get heavy.
I’m just going to rip the bandaid off now. This is a pretty harsh chaser… more

This is one of the best noir films ever made. It does amazingly well with a tangled plot and doesn’t get lost. It builds such a rich world and has such metropolitan feel. The message of tolerance and dismantling stereotypes is done well without being too heavy handed. It is so robust and lives when the camera doesn’t focus on the characters. I wish I could plot D&D like this.

i don't know if i was unreasonably pessimistic going in, but this was way more fun that i expected! i like puns, i like things that are unexpectedly perhaps the best buddy cop movie of the past decade, and i like movies that cram in so many little visual jokes that it makes me want to scale the wall at the back of the theater and crawl into the projector room so i can hit pause to fully appreciate all the layers. surely the other paying moviegoers won't mind. it's for a good cause (making sure we catch all the jokes).

The first part of this cartoon is something incredible. I think it’s one of my favourite cartoons. I so like this fox and rabbit. They’re duo, I don’t know what to say. I think if people don’t like cartoons when they grow up, they won’t understand anything. So I really like this

Enfin j'ai remate Zootopia (on dirait la 1ere)
On suit l'arrivée à Zootopia de Judy Hopps une policière qui rêve de faire ce travail depuis son enfance. Cependant, malgré tous ses efforts pour devenir flic elle est reléguée au service de stationnement mais elle arrive à prendre un dossier qui va s'avérer plus grand qu'elle ne le croyait.
Le film est moderne y a rien de spécial c'est du Disney. Les acteurs sont vraiment bons Jason Bateman waouh. La musique… more

At its heart, this is a story about optimism running headfirst into reality.
Zootopia opens with a children’s play that efficiently lays out how this world works. It’s playful and funny, but it also quietly establishes the social rules that will shape everything that follows. Judy Hopps grows up believing that hard work and determination can overcome any obstacle, an idea that’s quickly tested.
That uphill battle is clear from the start. Judy’s childhood encounter with a fox bully, and… more

The biggest weakness of this film is that it tries to hammer its message home. However, for once, there is also a film surrounding this message, and it is a damn entertaining, funny, and sweet film.

A: 2016 nostalgia otherwise total cop propaganda. not terrible, wish Judy was a little less polite and a little more commandeering because there was a significant lack of girl power for a kids movie about a girl cop. animation is very fun and cute though. cosy film when you treat it like a kids movie.
L: I mean overall a generally good movie. More or less the same. Like the Waltuh and ""wire""man part. Real 3/5.

Zootopia was a really fun watch and much more than just a kids’ movie. It clearly caters to adults as well, with smart themes and humour that works for both younger and older audiences. The story is easy to follow, engaging throughout, and keeps you entertained while still delivering a meaningful message in a light and enjoyable way.
3-Line Story Summary
Judy Hopps, a small-town rabbit, becomes the first of her kind to join the Zootopia police force.… more

j’ai adoré le revoir, Disney a beau sortir des dessins animés à un rythme infernal, force est de constater qu’ils sont encore capable de produire de la qualité (kilukru)
les adultes savoureront les nombreuses références cachées tout au long du film, l’histoire est intelligente et se permet même une belle démonstration des magouilles des politiciens (et ça on adore #lepenaucachot #sarkoenzonzon #bardepaslà eheh)

A modern classic really. A fun, exiting, and interesting family movie. Good music, fun characters and animation. Interesting world building. I got the whole package. And at the same time portraying any sort of racism or presumption in a fun new way.

Jest urokliwy i niesie za sobą ważne przesłanie, ale wszystko jest tutaj tak banalnie przedstawione, że jednak nawet jak na bajkę trochę mu brakuje, bo ciężko się zaangażować w fabułę jeśli od pierwszych 5 minut znasz jej przebieg. Mimo wszystko animacja jest naprawdę niezła, a prostą intrygę bardzo do przodu pcha udana chemia głównej dwójki bohaterów.

i really loved zootopia. it’s such a happy movie, watching it instantly lifted my mood.
i was completely obsessed with that bunny. she is unbearably cute, like maximum cuteness overload. and the fox...okay, whatever animal he is!!! is insanely FINE. i don’t care if they’re animals. if he’s attractive, he’s attractive. PERIOD.
their journey together was genuinely fun and heartwarming. what i loved most is the message behind the story. the bunny proves that you don’t have to be big,… more

Zootopia from 2016 — after years of memes, praise, and endless discussions about it.
Animation & world-building — top tier. Disney delivered one of their best-looking films at the time: insane level of detail in the city, distinct districts, fur textures, lighting — everything is on point. Zootopia feels like a living, breathing place, not just a backdrop.
Themes — easily the strongest part. Racism, stereotypes, systemic discrimination, fear of the “other,” fearmongering as a tool for power, even microaggressions —… more

As I'm writing this, ICE has been occupying Minneapolis for nearly two weeks, and the local FOP has announced they stand with immigration enforcement. Having the first act of Zootopia being about Judy Hopps' single-minded goal to become a police officer in order to help people is a tough sit.

This film does an incredible job at making an adventurous and engaging story for kids while also stuffing it full with mature societal issues and media references! And I’m so here for it!
~
The animation and world creation is gorgeous, and the ability to create unique/memorable side and main characters with very little screen time is impressive!
~
It makes sense why I enjoy this movie so much as one of the directors, Rich Moore, is also the man who directed Wreck-It-Ralph! Hats off to you sir, once again!

Good stuff! Really enjoyed this one. Funny, touching, mystery solving, socio-political and visual eye-candy. The CGI animation, character design and world-building are top notch for 2016.
A utopian fantasy world is portrayed, where pretty much everyone gets along no matter what their DNA may dictate. With its many and varied animal species, it’s obviously an allegory for differences like race, identity and cultural background. Focusing on equality for all, even if there are real individual biological limitations, which is largely… more

Yes the self awareness for how fucking racist almost everyone is in this film is a bad thing.
Somehow no one apologizes besides the main lead for how badly the “predators” were being treated and instead forget all about it and cut to the cliched forced happy ending dance sequence. The writers knew what they were trying to accomplish with this and instead of focusing on eliminating the bigoted mindsets people have here they express it freely without hesitation just… more

Judy Hopps talks so much about making the world a better place and immediately turns around and writes twice the amount of parking tickets she needs to. I’m sure the struggling single possum mother of 30 is really stoked that she needs to pay 200 zootopence to the ZPD. Judy also immediately racially profiles Nick Wilde upon meeting him, classic police officer activity.

Zootopia usa o formato de animação para articular críticas sociais surpreendentemente diretas e assustadoramente atuais. A burocracia lenta, os estigmas dentro das forças policiais (sejam eles de género, aparência ou “força”) e a incompetência institucional surgem como obstáculos reais à justiça e à mudança.
O filme expõe ainda a lógica perigosa da generalização da culpa: a criação de um inimigo comum, o pânico moral e a instrumentalização do medo como forma de acumulação e manutenção do poder. Tudo isto é… more

Easy to say it's just a kids film, but its themes are genuinely full of depth and looking at the current state of American politics, I think this film is something that's needed. Watching the 2nd one this afternoon and I hope it's at least somewhat near the same level of depth for what disguises itself as a kids film.
