0.5,2026-01-15,"Zootopia is an animated movie that seems far more interested in making sure you understand its message than in trusting you to enjoy the story. From early on, the film’s allegory for racism is pushed so hard it stops being allegory and starts feeling like a checklist. Every conflict exists to reinforce the same point, and characters regularly pause the momentum to restate the moral in plain terms. There’s little room for subtext, ambiguity, or audience interpretation. If you somehow missed the message the first time, don’t worry—the movie will repeat it again, slower, and with emphasis. What’s frustrating is that the world-building and premise are genuinely clever. But instead of letting themes emerge naturally, the film insists on guiding your reaction at every step. By the second half, the messaging becomes so overt and self-satisfied that it actively hurts watchability. It’s not offensive. It’s exhausting. A movie that mistakes repetition for depth and sincerity for insight.",157,en,zootopia animated movie seems far interested making sure understand message trusting enjoy story early film allegory racism pushed hard stop allegory start feeling like checklist every conflict exists reinforce point character regularly pause momentum restate moral plain term little room subtext ambiguity audience interpretation somehow missed message first time worry movie repeat slower emphasis frustrating world building premise genuinely clever instead letting theme emerge naturally film insists guiding reaction every step second half messaging becomes overt self satisfied actively hurt watchability offensive exhausting movie mistake repetition depth sincerity insight,2026-01,89

The introduction of Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) brings a completely different rhythm, with a presence that fills the screen. From that moment on, the story finds the right pace. The ensemble of characters serves solely to move the plot forward; they are merely tools for stitching the narrative together. The protagonists, Judy (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick (Jason Bateman), are the ones who carry all the emotional and narrative weight. They bring dynamism, memorable moments, and establish the essential connection with the audience. The plot feels slow at times, yet it remains interesting and enjoyable. The humor is well integrated and works for all audiences. It is one of those animated films that clearly embraces its identity as animation: it does not aim for realism but instead defines its characteristics with precision. It conveys a clear message of personal growth, showing that even when you feel out of place, it is still possible to carve out your own path.

4.0,2025-11-17,"★★★★☆ Zootopia is that rare animated movie that works brilliantly as both a hilarious buddy-cop comedy for kids and a surprisingly sharp, layered allegory about prejudice, systemic bias, and the danger of fear-based politics for adults. The world-building is absolutely off the charts: a sprawling, fully realized metropolis where every district (from icy Tundratown to rainy Rainforest District) feels alive, detailed, and logically designed for animals of every size. The gag density is insane (the sloth DMV scene is still one of the funniest things ever animated), and the action sequences (especially the naturalist club chase and the climactic train fight) are genuinely thrilling. Judy Hopps is an all-timer protagonist: tiny, relentlessly optimistic, and forced to confront her own unconscious biases in ways that feel honest and earned. Nick Wilde’s slow journey from cynical hustler to proud cop is pure charm, and Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman have chemistry that leaps off the screen. Shakira’s ""Try Everything"" over the end credits still gives goosebumps every single time. It loses half a star only because the third-act ""big twist"" is a little convoluted and the villain’s motive feels a touch undercooked compared to the rest of the film’s nuance. Four stars: one for the laughs, one for the heart, one for the world you never want to leave, and one because it somehow made a story about predator-prey relations feel urgently relevant without ever preaching.

5.0,2025-06-01,I absolutely love this movie from start to finish and everything in between now don't get me wrong there might be a few moments here and there where I may not have particularly liked it for one reason or another. But it was only a mild dislike not hate or certainly not enraging. I can't say this for many movies I watched over the years with of course a few exceptions. The Lion King that's been my most favorite and top Disney movie of all time for many many years and still is I couldn't tell you how many times I watched that movie when I was a child and while I was growing up in my teens and adult years. But besides the point rarely do I find or barely at all do I find a movie that I find myself attached to or especially rewatching it more than once and though I cannot recount how many times I watched The Lion King. I can certainly tell you wholeheartedly without a doubt since I kept track from the first time I watch zootopia. I watched the movie in total of 16 times plus more. The plus more is for when I'm most certainly am going to be rewatching this movie again and again because I do not get sick and tired of it. Just like my beloved favorite Disney movie of The Lion King. But of course the amount of times you watch a movie does not make it the best movie. But rather it's the enjoyment and sense of comfort you get while watching the movie and I most certainly felt that and more. I felt even with my lackluster skills I can do something and make something big of myself. That I can improve and get better over time and that no matter how hard the obstacles get I will be able to get through them as long as I have a positive attitude and focus on the things I can do rather on the things I can't. And that is just one of many examples on how I felt when I was watching zootopia. How it's encourage me and how it's made me realize I had that special something within me the whole time I just never bothered to look and check if it was there. In any case I digress the point is I truly love this movie it's a masterpiece all in its own right and I truly look forward to and also excited for zootopia 2 coming on the way. And I most certainly will be recommending this movie to children and to my family and friends. P.S to those that worked on the movie of zootopia as well as those that we're doing the voice acting I truly thank you from the bottom of my heart for making such a wonderful movie. Also even though Lion King will forever be my most favorite top Disney movie I am happy to say officially zootopia has taken that top spot so before Lion King for me was number one and always will remain number one. But now the number one is zootopia and that will not change no matter what movies come after and even though now The Lion King is now second it certainly is not any less the best.,557,en,absolutely love movie start finish everything get wrong might moment may particularly liked one reason another mild dislike hate certainly enraging say many movie watched year course exception lion king favorite top disney movie time many many year still tell many time watched movie child growing teen adult year besides point rarely find barely find movie find attached especially rewatching though cannot recount many time watched lion king certainly tell wholeheartedly without doubt since kept track first time watch zootopia watched movie total time plus plus certainly going rewatching movie get sick tired like beloved favorite disney movie lion king course amount time watch movie make best movie rather enjoyment sense comfort get watching movie certainly felt felt even lackluster skill something make something big improve get better time matter hard obstacle get able get long positive attitude focus thing rather thing one many example felt watching zootopia encourage made realize special something within whole time never bothered look check case digress point truly love movie masterpiece right truly look forward also excited zootopia coming way certainly recommending movie child family friend p worked movie zootopia well voice acting truly thank bottom heart making wonderful movie also even though lion king forever favorite top disney movie happy say officially zootopia taken top spot lion king number one always remain number one number one zootopia change matter movie come even though lion king second certainly less best,2025-06,236

These disfunctions are well hidden for the most part, until the final 30 minutes. The movie suffers from tonal whiplash as they transition from one plot point to the other. Still a good time, the film just gets a heavy handed with their commentary towards the end.

5.0,2020-12-04,"The Best Film Of The Year, So Far. From the studio that brought you Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen & Big Hero 6, Zootopia surfaces as a highly original, incredibly refreshing, thoroughly engaging, surprisingly timely & delightfully subversive beast fable about prejudice & stereotype that not only marks a new creative high for Disney but is arguably the finest film that this legendary animation studio has come up with in their Revival Era, so far. Set in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, the story of Zootopia takes place in the titular metropolis and follows a bunny cop named Judy Hopps who, despite her par excellent performance in the class, is assigned parking duty by her superior. But when she volunteers to undertake a missing-predator case, she is given 48 hours to solve the mystery or resign, following which she blackmails a sly fox into helping her, and uncovers a sinister conspiracy. Co-directed by Byron Howard & Rich Moore, the duo put up an intriguing world on the screen that does have a fresh quality but there is still a deep sense of familiarity to it. However, where the two leave a lasting impression is in finding that perfect balance between its consistently gripping storyline & moments of pure hilarity. The writing staff also deserves a mention, for their screenplay brims with numerous pop culture references, parodies many renowned classics & handles its topical themes with care. The 3D animation is absolutely top-notch, for the images retain its crispness, clarity & vibrancy from beginning to end. The animators put up a vast number of characters on the screen, ranging from the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, yet they are all given a well-defined arc. Cinematography further enhances the overall look n feel of the story with its fluid camera-work, splendid use of colour palette & spot-on lighting. Editing provides just enough screen time to all the relevant characters while moving the plot forward at a blistering pace. The cast is wisely chosen, and all the actors do a competent job in lending their voice & soul to the mammals they play. Ginnifer Goodwin brings a bubbly side to the new cop in town and confidently plays her role. Jason Bateman plays his part with finesse plus his voice really fits his cynical con artist character. Also, the chemistry between the two is a highlight in itself. Michael Giacchino's ebullient score seamlessly blends in & compliments the narrative while Shakira beautifully wraps everything up with a catchy, uplifting & wonderful song that smartly summarises its themes & message. On an overall scale, Zootopia finds Disney stepping out of its comfort zone to tackle a bold, ambitious & risky project, and it is one gamble that pays off tremendously well in the studio's favour. Also, its arrival couldn't have been better, considering how its elements of prejudice & stereotypes mirror the racial hostilities present in our very own current social environment. An ingenious blend of sophisticated storytelling, jubilant humour & thought-provoking themes that amazes, entertains & enlightens without ever compromising with the fun factor, Zootopia is a definite delight for viewers of all ages, and is undoubtedly the best film of the year, so far.

The pacing was good, the main characters were solid, the voice acting was fantastic, there was some good humour, and there were various entertaining references to other films like The Godfather.

Ginnifer Goodwin (Judy) leads the cast very well, while Jason Bateman gives the most memorable performance as Nick. Idris Elba and Jenny Slate (not Edie Falco or Constance Shulman, as I initially guessed... just me? Probably) are good too. The premise is actually my favourite part of this film.

4.5,2020-07-10,"Zootopia is a fun buddy-cop movie that's filled to the brim with sharp comedy and imaginative worldbuilding. On top of the gorgeous animation, it's impressive with how they were able to design a city that accommodated the different sizes and biome preferences of its diverse mammalian residents. You can tell they put a lot of time, research, add passion into this aspect of the movie. And that's just the icing on the cake. The characters are very likeable and share great chemistry thanks to the film's stellar cast and screenwriting. Jason Bateman as the fast-talking fox con-artist Nick Wilde stole the show for me with his snarky comedic timing and unexpected emotional resonance that's peeled away like an onion as the movie goes on. The movie takes n interesting approach with its heavy and relevant themes of racial prejudice. Unfortunately the themes can get muddled its symbolism with some potentially unfortunate implications when it comes to the allegories of predators/prey with real life race relations. However, I still respect the filmmakers' intentions of weaving this relevant subject matter into the narrative of an already imaginatively entertaining and charming animated family film.",191,en,zootopia fun buddy cop movie filled brim sharp comedy imaginative worldbuilding top gorgeous animation impressive able design city accommodated different size biome preference diverse mammalian resident tell put lot time research add passion aspect movie icing cake character likeable share great chemistry thanks film stellar cast screenwriting jason bateman fast talking fox con artist nick wilde stole show snarky comedic timing unexpected emotional resonance peeled away like onion movie go movie take n interesting approach heavy relevant theme racial prejudice unfortunately theme get muddled symbolism potentially unfortunate implication come allegory predator prey real life race relation however still respect filmmaker intention weaving relevant subject matter narrative already imaginatively entertaining charming animated family film,2020-07,113

From the amazing chemistry and witty dialogue between Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde to the heavy underlying themes about prejudice, discrimination, and labeling others, whatever Zootopia sets out to achieve it does. The computer animation here is gorgeous with sprawling ecosystems, incredible animal designs (the fur on Hopps and Wilde look impressive on a 4K screen), and clever set designs for an urban area made for many different types and sizes of creatures. On surface level, without thinking too much about the themes, it also works as a crime/mystery film about Officer Hopps discovering why some animals seem to be going back to their ""biological tendencies"" whilst teaming up with an unlikely partner. Additionally, the moments where Hopps and Wilde's friendship gets hurt and repaired hit those Disney emotional beats that are sure to make you teary eyed then so heartwarming.

I loved the messages, all the unexpected twist (yes, indeed there were, for me, unexpected twist in this kind of predictable movie), the characters, the look of it all, ugh, I just loved it. Okay, so it's about this world where animals (predators and prey) live amongst each other in peace. There is a bunny called Judy Hopps and she dreams big. She wants to be the fist bunny cop and while no one believes in her, she believes in herself. And yes, she end up becoming a cop. But because she is a bunny she gets to do the not so fun job. Until one day she gets 48 hours to solve a missing Otter crime. She gets help from a fox ""criminal"" called Nick Wilde. They take on the adventure together, and through the ups and downs they find the guilty party and learn valuable lessons. One of the things I adored in this movie is the messages. Which is, even if everybody disencourge you, you have to believe in yourself and go get what you want or become who you want to be. I think that's one great messages and I really believe kids and even grown ups can learn a lot from it. The message was pretty clear throughout the whole movie, so that was great as well. Also, The movie is so well made. All the different areas in Zootopia were all so unique and beautifully crafted. They really did a great job. The humor in this movie was amazing. The film started and I was already laughing. The voice actors were chosen very well, they really brought life to the characters and their emotions.

Everything from the setting to the characters contributes to this real life comparison of racism and honestly it works soooo well! I don't even mind that the entire film felt slightly too present day with the iphones and technology, because the way this film is set up, is that it is telling a story of racism present day. Give this a few decades and it will go down as a classic guaranteed! My biggest complaint with this film is the villain at the end. There was no sign or anything that bellwether would be the villain. It felt lazily thrown in at last minute to give an evil mastermind behind the work. Her intentions line up, but still feel a little weak since honestly any prey animal could say that those were their intentions.

In fact, I think that in the 90s it was not very creative to use animal worlds in cartoons, as the failure of cats does not dance. Nobody gave a damn for anthropomorphic animals, with the exception of the furrys in deviantart and furaffinity.net. since I speak of this, this that I say is not a weight that affects the movie, but if the fandom. As you know, as soon as a trailer was shown in English of the movie, and in a few hours or a day, they already had sexualized the protagonists of the movie, the little rabbit Tte.

4.5,2018-09-07,"Do you like animated movies with a good message? Well, this movie is for you. It's called Zootopia, it was released on March 17, 2016 and was directed by Rich Moore and Byron Howard. Like I mentioned before, it's an animated movie and it's about a fictitious mammal city called Zootopia, where a bunny wants to be a police officer. Since it's an animated movie, people just give their voice to the characters in it, and the main voices in this movie are Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman. Ginnifer Goodwin is an actress that is mainly known for ""Big Love"" series and the movie I'm talking about, Zootopia and Jason Bateman is mainly known for ""Arrested development"" series, ""Bad words"" and Zootopia, also he won the Golden Globe Award for the best actor in TV series for ""Arrested development"". In the movie Ginnifer Goodwin gives her voice to Judy Hopps and Jason Bateman gives his voice to Nick Wilde. In my opinion they both did very good voices in all the movie context because the emotions in all the scenes are very clear and also the dialogs are totally understandable. The plot is about a young bunny (Judy) that wants to be a police officer when she grows up, everybody in her town wanted to stop her but she didn't give up and she made her dreams come true, achieving her goal. In my opinion the story is very entertaining because in Judy's process to be a police officer there are a lot of people she meets and a lot of difficulties she pass through. In general, the movie is very good in its animated cinematography, also the soundtrack is really awesome and specially because there is one song that the famous singer Shakira sings. One of the best scenes in all the movie is when Judy and his partner Nick run away from a jaguar because it turns savage in a rainforest. Since Zootopia is an animated movie, the special effects are made according to the all the computer-made animation, but they're very well made because they cause impact to some children that make them like the movie, and the emotions in the movie are very impressive, especially for kids, because they are very good expressed and you feel like if they were real. My rating for this movie is of 9/10 stars, so I think it's an awesome movie and the people who watch it will be very appointed with it, also I recommend people to watch it because it's very creative and entertaining with all the scenographies and the characters presented in the movie, and finally, this movie shows you a good lesson: Don't give up if you have a goal you want to achieve, even if something or someone tries to stop you.

5.0,2018-08-21,"Normally I enjoy animated films because they're are usually visually stunning and that is enough to hold my attention. Some I love and some I just enjoy even if they are flawed. But I was fairly excited for this film so I watched it, because I'm a sucker for animated films, and I was absolutely blown away by this movie and it surpassed my expectations. Firstly, Zootropolis (or Zootopia depending where you come from) is much, much more than your generic Disney film. It will actually entertain a higher age demographic rather than younger kids due to it's exciting story and mature themes and because it is more a crime drama than a comedy. Yes, the directors and writers aren't afraid to explore much more darker and mature themes then they usually do and they do throw in a few jump worthy parts. On the other hand, the kids will probably enjoy seeing the animals speak but adults will be really engaged because of it's story. This film definitely deserved it's Academy Award Oscar for 'Best Animated Feature'. Secondly, this film had me hooked all the way through because of its detective and mysterious themes and its crime drama story, it's frequently humourous sequences and because the film had a surprising amount of an emotional weight towards it. Even though the tone is normally dark for an animated Disney film, the film still allows for some hilarious moments that, luckily, doesn't affect the overall tone. And like all modern Disney films, this film has stunning backdrops and top-notch animation and the soundtrack isn't half bad, either, alongside side it's exciting score. Furthermore, Zootropolis works well because of it's extremely likeable characters, who have emotional and sympathetic backstories, it's story, which is well paced, extremely well told and presented, and as the chemistry between Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps is rich and compelling because of it's well written dialogue and great casting choices including Idris Elba, Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman. Not only that but Zootropolis thrills in it's tension filled action sequences and due to it's shocking plot twists; Zootropolis also allows Godfather fans to be delighted as well. In the end, Zootropolis isn't your average animated film because it is much more than that, it has an extremely intriguing, unprecedented presence and a well told story and is aided by compelling characters and fun moments. Zootropolis not only sets a bar high for future animated films but is probably one the best animated films ever made as of 2016. Additionally, Zootropolis is also one of the most enjoyable family films ever made.

5.0,2018-04-11,"Zootropolis (Zootopia) was a part of my highly anticipated list of movies for this year. Sure, Deadpool looked amazing (and was, according to nearly everyone) and Batman V Superman was the NEXT BIG THING but there was just something about Zootropolis that made me so excited. After reviews started rolling in, it got me even more excited, Chris Stuckmann's review especially. (Link at the bottom of review) And now I finally got to watch it. And I can simply say that Zootropolis was...AMAZING! Oh by the way, this review is SPOILER FREE. The Story Zootropolis's story is about a passionate little bunny known as Judy Hopps. She wants to do good for the world and decides that she wants to be a cop. This isn't very common and many of the other animals show that but Judy thinks that everyone can be whoever they want to be. When she has her first case, she isn't given much so she teams up with a fox known as Nick Wilde to help her solve the case. I really like this story as Nick and Judy get to learn more about each other throughout the story and as well as that, it results in a really fun, family adventure. The Characters Oh my the characters. In my opinion, this is Zootropolis's strongest parts. They are just so likeable! And before I talk about them, I have to talk about how well the actors portray them. I think Ginnifer Goodwin did a brilliant job at voicing Judy and I haven't seen many movies with Jason Bateman as a voice of a character or a character but I think he did an excellent job as Nick. And I can't forget Idris Elba's performance as Chief Bogo (the one who gives out the cases) He nailed it. Alright, now what I thought about them. Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde steal the show completely. (well, they are the main characters)They both have strengths and weaknesses which show throughout the movie a lot and they do have some really funny, touching and quite crazy moments that I will not spoil. And even though Chief Bogo is that character who can be a bit of a jerk at the beginning, you come to see him from a different perspective when the movie goes on. There are many more characters that do a really good job but this section is already too big. On to the animation. The Animation As usual, Disney did a great job with the animation. The action scenes look great, the visuals are fantastic and the city itself is huge. I may now sound like i'm doing a video game review but i'm not. The city is beautiful with flying colors. (quite literally actually) So yeah, they did a really good job, as usual. The Comedy If you watch Chris Stuckmann's Review, he says that: ""It is more focused on it's story then making you laugh. And that's something I loved about it."" And I agree. I think the story is brilliant and because of it, when the jokes come up, there actually hilarious. The comedy is focused around children and adults so of course, there will be jokes where only the adults will laugh or only the children. According to other reviewers, the scene with ""Mr Big"" was paying homage to: ""The Godfather."" And even though I haven't seen The Godfather, the whole scene was really funny. This goes to show you what you're going to expect. And here's the final part of the review... The Serious Note/ The Message Now is when I talk to you about the serious note. This movie focuses on so many different subjects you don't think a Disney movie would ever cover. I actually quite like it because it adds a little more originality to it. If you have ever watched Happy Feet, it was trying to deliver a message. But the way they did was so childlike that it made it pointless for older kids or adults. But Zootopia did it with a more serious tone and a non forceful way that it really delivered it well. The Grade I love Zootropolis. It's message is brought well, it's animation is great, it's characters are awesome, it's comedy is hilarious, it's story is brilliant and it's serious tone makes it even better. This movie is defiantly 100% worth watching and i'm going to give it an A+ Chris Stuckmann's Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du7wcFPBfIE",742,en,zootropolis zootopia part highly anticipated list movie year sure deadpool looked amazing according nearly everyone batman v superman next big thing something zootropolis made excited review started rolling got even excited chris stuckmann review especially link bottom review finally got watch simply say zootropolis amazing oh way review spoiler free story zootropolis story passionate little bunny known judy hopps want good world decides want cop common many animal show judy think everyone whoever want first case given much team fox known nick wilde help solve case really like story nick judy get learn throughout story well result really fun family adventure character oh character opinion zootropolis strongest part likeable talk talk well actor portray think ginnifer goodwin brilliant job voicing judy seen many movie jason bateman voice character character think excellent job nick forget idris elba performance chief bogo one give case nailed alright thought judy hopps nick wilde steal show completely well main character strength weakness show throughout movie lot really funny touching quite crazy moment spoil even though chief bogo character bit jerk beginning come see different perspective movie go many character really good job section already big animation animation usual disney great job animation action scene look great visuals fantastic city huge may sound like video game review city beautiful flying color quite literally actually yeah really good job usual comedy watch chris stuckmann review say focused story making laugh something loved agree think story brilliant joke come actually hilarious comedy focused around child adult course joke adult laugh child according reviewer scene mr big paying homage godfather even though seen godfather whole scene really funny go show going expect final part review serious note message talk serious note movie focus many different subject think disney movie would ever cover actually quite like add little originality ever watched happy foot trying deliver message way childlike made pointless older kid adult zootopia serious tone non forceful way really delivered well grade love zootropolis message brought well animation great character awesome comedy hilarious story brilliant serious tone make even better movie defiantly worth watching going give chris stuckmann review http www youtube com watch v du wcfpbfie,2018-04,358

4.5,2018-03-16,"Zootopia is the 30th highest grossing film of all time, and the fourth animated film to pass $1 billion in global box-office earnings. Judy Hopps, the determined and enthusiastic main character, decides she wants better for herself, even when something else is expected. She faces many hardships as she realizes that creating a different reality for herself will be a lot harder than she first believed. Her difficulties point to the fact that she is a female, and a smaller prey species. In the end, Judy is successful in creating the change that she had been wanting for so long. Zootopia was created to teach people of all ages that goals and dreams can be reached through hard work and determination, no matter what circumstances they may be in. The directors were successful in getting the point across. This essay will analyze the use of irony, symbolism, and a great storyline to show evidence of the creators purpose throughout the film. The directors of Zootopia waste no time in presenting situational irony in the beginning. The main characters are introduced, and we meet Judy Hopps. She is a small bunny with a very large family, and two carrot farmers for parents. She is literally at the ""bottom of the food chain"" in her society. The ironic part of the situation is that she wants to become a police officer. In her world, this workforce is comprised only of large male animals. The creators do this to immediately place her in a position where she is at a disadvantage. To the viewers, her wish to become a cop is almost comical, and the task seems impossible because of her situation. In the end, however, Judy does become a police officer. She not only becomes a cop, she ends up being one of the most successful ones who solves a huge mystery case. The overall story is a testament that if Judy can turn her life around, anyone can. Symbolism is also included in the movie, and it is one of the most powerful tools used in the film to convey the creator's purpose. The characters present in the movie represent many different types of people in the real world. The wide variety of animal species shown in the film are meant to represent the different races, social classes, intelligence levels, etc.., that are present in today's world. The directors do this to give viewers the ability to connect with certain characters that they might be similar to in reality. This is meant to empower the minds of young viewers as they watch the actions of the characters that they connect with. They see them working hard to set goals, and successfully achieve them. This leaves people with a healthy mindset and a hope that they can always better themselves, no matter the circumstances. The overall story itself is another way the point is made. Judy's life and work are anything but easy, and she is constantly dealing with new challenges. She stays optimistic and hopeful for most of the movie, but there is one instance where she finds herself wanting to give up because of the hardships she is facing. These details are crucial to the development of the main idea because it shows viewers how to deal with problems in a healthy way, while maintaining a good attitude. On the other hand, it also shows that the road will be tough, and there will be times where quitting will sound like the best option. Judy does not give up though, and we see her push forward and succeed in the end. Some people think that Zootopia is simply just a kid movie made to do nothing but entertain young children. While the story is animated and easy enough for kids to understand, it has way too many good messages in it to be considered just a kids movie. It teaches things in a way that people of all ages can understand, but the messages taught are very beneficial for people to learn at a young age and carry with them for the rest of their lives. Zootopia is a great film that everyone must see at some point in life. The lessons of hard work and determination are presented through a variety of tools that definitely get the point across to the viewers of the movie. It does this while also remaining exciting and entertaining for young children to enjoy. Judy Hopps is placed in a tough situation, but leaves it successful and strong. Her journey captivates the hearts and minds of many and gives the opportunity for viewers to be inspired by her success and character. The directors want everyone to know that it doesn't matter if a journey has a less than great start. The only thing that matters is that the goal is reached and that there was something learned from the process of getting there.",819,en,zootopia th highest grossing film time fourth animated film pas billion global box office earnings judy hopps determined enthusiastic main character decides want better even something else expected face many hardship realizes creating different reality lot harder first believed difficulty point fact female smaller prey specie end judy successful creating change wanting long zootopia created teach people age goal dream reached hard work determination matter circumstance may director successful getting point across essay analyze use irony symbolism great storyline show evidence creator purpose throughout film director zootopia waste time presenting situational irony beginning main character introduced meet judy hopps small bunny large family two carrot farmer parent literally bottom food chain society ironic part situation want become police officer world workforce comprised large male animal creator immediately place position disadvantage viewer wish become cop almost comical task seems impossible situation end however judy become police officer becomes cop end one successful one solves huge mystery case overall story testament judy turn life around anyone symbolism also included movie one powerful tool used film convey creator purpose character present movie represent many different type people real world wide variety animal specie shown film meant represent different race social class intelligence level etc present today world director give viewer ability connect certain character might similar reality meant empower mind young viewer watch action character connect see working hard set goal successfully achieve leaf people healthy mindset hope always better matter circumstance overall story another way point made judy life work anything easy constantly dealing new challenge stay optimistic hopeful movie one instance find wanting give hardship facing detail crucial development main idea show viewer deal problem healthy way maintaining good attitude hand also show road tough time quitting sound like best option judy give though see push forward succeed end people think zootopia simply kid movie made nothing entertain young child story animated easy enough kid understand way many good message considered kid movie teach thing way people age understand message taught beneficial people learn young age carry rest life zootopia great film everyone must see point life lesson hard work determination presented variety tool definitely get point across viewer movie also remaining exciting entertaining young child enjoy judy hopps placed tough situation leaf successful strong journey captivates heart mind many give opportunity viewer inspired success character director want everyone know matter journey less great start thing matter goal reached something learned process getting,2018-03,402

4.0,2018-01-01,"I'm actually a bit surprised Disney took a stab at a movie with this kind of weight. Maybe it's because I watched Hidden Figures yesterday or that headlines each day remind me of the great dichotomy of ""us vs. them..."" Zootopia is a movie about race, and I don't expect it to be the last one I watch in this year's Academy lineup. Rather than addressing race on, Zootopia is wise in the way many newer Disney movies have made commentary through analogy. ""Predators versus prey"" is something we teach all children, but framing race as Zootopia does allows parents to have a much-needed discussion with the next generation of global citizens. It's especially poignant that in this classic crime story, the case - and the racial inequality - is solved by small-town residents unaware that their own actions have a meaningful impact on the equality of the world. Like I said, hats off to Disney. As a nominee for the Best Animated category, it's still too early to say if Zootopia has the chops to take out its Disney sibling Moana or the other movies on the list. There are some stunning examples of animation, especially with falling rain, waterfalls, and other liquids - that's one area of animation I often forget is animated. It's hard not to fall in love with each character in Zootopia, and the animation does everything to support (and nothing to detract) from that process as a member of the audience. Though it seems like a bit of a sleeper among their animated lineup (especially with the early March 2016 release it had), I'm excited that Zootopia will get seen by a few more children - and a few more adults - as a result of its nomination. Zootopia will probably end up on my shelf when I have kids, if only for how well it handles race relations. I'm still wondering whether I'm 'predator' or 'prey,' and if I even want to be.",330,en,actually bit surprised disney took stab movie kind weight maybe watched hidden figure yesterday headline day remind great dichotomy u v zootopia movie race expect last one watch year academy lineup rather addressing race zootopia wise way many newer disney movie made commentary analogy predator versus prey something teach child framing race zootopia allows parent much needed discussion next generation global citizen especially poignant classic crime story case racial inequality solved small town resident unaware action meaningful impact equality world like said hat disney nominee best animated category still early say zootopia chop take disney sibling moana movie list stunning example animation especially falling rain waterfall liquid one area animation often forget animated hard fall love character zootopia animation everything support nothing detract process member audience though seems like bit sleeper among animated lineup especially early march release excited zootopia get seen child adult result nomination zootopia probably end shelf kid well handle race relation still wondering whether predator prey even want,2018-01,162

This movie also has many entertaining scenes, but of the best entertaining scene is when Judy and Nick go to the sloths at the Department of Motor Vehicles for the car information. Of course, But the happiness that we get from the movie was the true love and positive attitude of Judy and Nick. The characters in this movie were very impressive and innocent. Judy made a big impression on the audience. Judy had a positive personality. She cared for others more than herself. Zootopia is a one of the best animated movies that I have ever watched. I thought Zootopia would just be a silly kid's movie, but I was wrong. Judy and Nick showed everything throughout their friendship, happiness and entertainment in the real world, and even sometime characters in the movie can help you decide major life decisions.

The supervisions were Rich Moore who is known as supervision of ""The Simpson's"" and ""Sugar Rush"" and Byron Howard, who is known as a supervision of ""Mulan"" and ""Tangled"". This movie were so famous and won 41 awards all over the world. This movie tells us three important things. First, to keep dreaming is important to realize our dream. The main character of rabbit Judy had had a dream since she was a child but her parents thought her dream cannot come true. However, she kept tying everything to realize her dream so hardly. We will be changed our mind by her action in this movie. Second, we should live together without discrimination. There were two kind of animals carnivores and herbivores in this movie. We think herbivorous were weaker than carnivores but this thought made a dangerous problem in this story. Finally, to deceive is bad. The character of fox Nick deceived many animals with his partner of fennec fox Finnick. However, their minds had changed since they met Judy. I personally think our world and thought will change brighter and positive after we watch this movie. The main character of rabbit Judy had dream to be a police in Zootopia. Zootopia is one utopia which carnivores and herbivores can live together. However, her parents did not think her dream comes true because she is a rabbit. Actually all the police had been carnivores before she became to a police in Zootopia. However, she did not give up and try to everything. Her effort bore fruit and became a police in Zootopia. However, there were discriminations between carnivores and herbivores in her workplace. Subsequently, she found Nick deceived animals for getting much money when she was going on patrol in Zootopia. He promised to help her work in order to get released. Their combination solved many problems in Zootopia and animals' thought of carnivores and herbivores relationship was changed by their working. We can learn three important things to live in our earth from this story. First, to keep dreaming, second, we should live together without discrimination and lastly, to deceive is bad. This movie gives good effect not only adults, but also children. Therefore, I recommend watching this movie with family. I especially like Judy and Nick's combination. Judy is a herbivore and Nick is a carnivore, so they were different kinds from animal, but they made good relationship each other little by little. It told us we could make the good relationships even if we are different.

2.5,2017-09-20,"I didn't know what to think about this movie before I saw it. There was so much hype I was afraid to be disappointed. All I knew was that it was highly anticipated, and when it came out people went crazy for it. Critics and audiences alike loved this movie for being ""real,"" and coming out at ""just the right time in America."" This was mainly due to the fact that film talks a lot about race, while not talking directly about race. You see, it's like Paddington, Babar, or Curious George in that way. It talks about race, but only through animals. So it's not actually portraying people of color, but using anthropomorphic creatures to do so. The movie would have been so much more effective if they animated people of color and the institutions which keep white people privileged. But they don't. Instead it's incredibly confusing when it comes to who are the haves, and who are the have nots. They may have done this to be ambiguous in order to show that many people are intersectional, but because they're animals, it doesn't really work that way. Like do black sheep have different standards and societal expectations than white sheep? The animal allegory doesn't work unless they're all the same animal because it literally shows us that races are different species (eugenics), when that isn't true. Lastly, you can map out the plot from a mile away. So let's dive into the good, the bad and the ugly, with Zootopia. Very simply put, the movie is about a rabbit and a fox. The rabbit, named Judy, wants to be a cop. But because she's a prey animal and also a woman - they don't really address gender that much, but for the sake of this review, I will - she's not supposed to be a cop, she's supposed to remain a little farm bunny. But like most Disney female characters she wants more than ""this provincial life,"" so she moves to Zootopia, a utopian city where prey and predator live together in harmony. This of course isn't true as Judy soon finds out. She faces prejudice as a prey animal at work and in the city, but decides to take her destiny in her own paws. She tackles a huge who done it mystery case and teams up with a criminal fox, Nick, and the unlikely duo solves the crime. The villain (spoilers) turns out to be a white sheep, a seemingly innocent prey animal. All in all, the moral is, looks can be deceiving, and anyone can be whatever they want to be, no matter what society says. I love the land of Zootopia. I think it's so creative how they make a Sahara part, a jungle part, a tundra part, and even a tiny rodent village. That's awesome! But aside from a few scenes, they don't really show much of the city. I also don't like how the animal allegory has so many plot holes. And this is mainly because the movie uses animals instead of people! Lastly, Shakira and Judy are constantly sexualized. The villain is obvious and the movie is long. Sitting through the misunderstanding between Nick and Judy was agonizing. So, the racial allegory, does it do its job? No. I was constantly confused in the movie if they were trying to confirm that reverse racism exists. Sometimes it seemed as though the prey were the people of color and the predators were white. This happens when Nick tries touching the sheep's hair and Judy says, ""You know you can't just touch a sheep's wool."" This is obviously mimicking real life, when you can't just go up and touch a black person's hair. Sometimes it makes it seem as though it's the other way around, and the prey are white and the people of color are predators. What the f*ck? This can be seen when the prey animals are trying to ""civilize"" the predators. The predators are thugs and ""black."" This can be seen with the jaguar who goes ""savage"" because savagery is a trait put on African Americans as well as indigenous people. So does that mean the prey is white and the people of color are predators? Maybe they're saying that the white people (prey) are actually the savages and taking a Pocahontas/Paddington route? I just don't know. And that's a problem because if the movie is going for a racial allegory, then it has to be clear. But instead it's muddled because Disney was too afraid to use people, so they used cute little animals to tell their ""progressive"" story. I also didn't like the comedic elements in the film. There was the nudist thing. Was that supposed to be funny? Animals not wearing clothes, ha-ha? Then The Godfather references were meh. It's been done before. Then of course you have the Disney/Pixar trope of juxtaposing an animal's size with the type of voice it has. In Zootopia, there's a small animal with a deep voice. It's similar to Up with the evil dog having a high pitched voice, or the cute baby form The Incredibles who is actually the devil. I'm TIRED OF IT. The other problematic part I have with the film is the sexualization of animals. I know they're supposed to be anthropomorphic and take on human qualities. But really, we're going give a bunny boobs and hips? We're going to sexualize Giselle -Shakira's character - by having the camera hold on her animal butt uncomfortably? These are animals! They're not sexy. Well, maybe they are to some people, but it's also adding to the sexualization of female characters. The men are not sexualized the same way the women are. In fact, the men are able to have a wide range of body types, while the females are given very little. But as for the main characters, Judy's body is much more ""feminine"" than Nick's. Nick just looks like a fox on his hind legs, but Judy is given curves, why, if not to titillate the presumably straight men watching it. I guess if I had to say something I liked about the film, it would have to be my favorite scene. I love the part where Judy is spying on Nick and discovers his undercover Popsicle scheme. It's really cool seeing different parts of the city, how his life works, and the different animals he meets. Nick, unlike Judy, rolls with his stereotype as the ""sly fox."" But this brings me to another problem, some animals fit into their stereotypes while others don't. Why is this? To create a wide range of characters, or for comedic effect? Ha-ha that animal doesn't fit into our expectations; therefore it's funny because they're different. I think the best example of this is the overweight cheetah who works the front desk at the Zootopia police department. He's a stereotypical fat, donut eating cop. But he's also fat, and a cheetah. Does that give his character depth? No, they just use him as a pawn to make some jokes with. There is a point where he has to move to the back of the office because predators are now scary, I don't know if he's supposed to be black or white here... he could be black because a lot of people in the human world discriminate against black people because they're not as universal as white people are. They're also seen as meaner and ruder. Therefore, why would you want one welcoming you at the front desk? Or could it be he's losing his white privilege? The movie doesn't make that very clear. So some animals fit into a stereotype, others don't (Judy). That fits in with the message that looks are deceiving, but sometimes looks are also true? Like cops eat donuts? The DMV are sloths? Also, in the end Nick and Judy get together, is that an allegory for an in interracial couple? Why didn't they just use real people? It would have been so much more effective. Also, if it is supposed to be a race allegory, can we tell what races/ethnicities the actors are by their voices? In my opinion, that's a common way people can make things seem ""diverse."" Of course it's impossible to know what race a person is by their voice, but it is used on the radio all the time to make their shows seem ""diverse."" Do you think it was used here? I knew the two leads were voiced by white people, I knew the Indian elephant was voiced by someone of Indian descent, and I knew that Mrs. Otterton was voiced by a black woman. I didn't know Chief Bogo was voiced by a black man however. This clearly shows that you can't tell what race people are by their voice, but that is the intention of some media, especially when the character is just a voice. And I think voice acting in animated shows use this trick too, in order to prove they have a diverse cast they may want to hire people with more of an 'accent' than others. And because of this, I was socialized to associate the hyenas from The Lion King, with black people. Thanks Disney. Overall, I just don't get it. I don't think the movie is ground breaking or diverse in anyway. I don't think the morals are very strong seeing that they're using animals to tell a human story. Wouldn't it have been stronger to tell it with real kids? Reflect real life with real people? Even CGI people would have been better than this. I give it a 7/10, and in my opinion, I'm being lenient.",1614,en,know think movie saw much hype afraid disappointed knew highly anticipated came people went crazy critic audience alike loved movie

Finally, the moral of this story is try everything even it hard to get the job. that message is very good. Let talk about Judy. Judy the rabbit was the excellent example because she believe herself and want to be the first rabbit to be the police officer at the Zootopia. even her parent thought it's too dangerous and challenge can be very difficult, she never give up her dream, past all challenge, and become the police officer.

4.5,2017-08-16,"Disney presents here an all-round impressive film, colourful and bright for a junior audience and remarkably thoughtful and profound for its older viewers. Visually stunning, the film is accentuated by a talented vocal cast, led by Ginnifer Goodwin who is simply perfect as bunny cop, Judy Hopps and Jason Bateman, with a very Fantastic Mr Fox-esque performance as Nick Wilde. The film's tone verges on some of the most threatening that we have ever seen from Disney, with sociological undertones that, despite being slightly glossed over, unfortunately, still are remarkably noticeable in the narrative. As a whole, the film is wonderfully creative and the world of Zootopia is both imaginatively thought out and stunningly executed. The plot is typical self-discovery, but Zootopia is a mystery flick, at heart. The plot is good, but you cannot help feeling the filmmakers had more potential to explore the world they had created and were holding back a little for what could have made the film more interesting. This is real nitpicking though; for the most part, Zootopia is one of the best Disney films ever made, certainly the best of the modern Renaissance.

5.0,2017-08-10,"""Disney: Hilariously Exploiting Stereotypes In Animal Form"" Who would have thought that another Disney animation focused on the lives of animals would be such a hit? If you want to laugh, cry, be uplifted, and experience a myriad of emotions, then Zootopia is the movie for you. Kids will love the cute animals depicted throughout the movie, as well as childish humor that kids will giggle hysterically at. Moreover, adults will not struggle with keeping their attention focused on the movie, like most ""Kid"" movies, because of the amazing artistry and captivating plot. An astounding feat that the film accomplished is the teaching opportunity it took to discuss, for all ages, real world issues that we struggle with around the world today. From the tiny stature of a mob boss arctic shrew, Mr. Big, to the largest elephant yoga teacher, the metropolis of Zootopia is a place thought to be where all types of animals can live, thrive, and make their dreams come true. This is the case for a small town bunny name Judy Hopps (wonderfully voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin). Judy a determined and peppy rabbit with the inability to stop pursuing her dreams becomes the first bunny police officer in Zootopia. With the odds stacked against her, Officer Hopps takes on a curious case that will make or break her dreams and the metropolis of Zootopia. On her quest, Judy pairs up with an unimaginable partner, a con artist fox named Nick Wilde (brilliantly voiced by Jason Bateman). Together the unthinkable partners have to piece together clues to solve the mysterious case that could prove to be the end of the marvelous metropolis of Zootopia. The amazing plot of the movie takes on the difficult task to teach its viewers the complexities and blatant issues of the world that may or may not be easily noticed. For example, two true enemies in the animal kingdom, a fox and bunny, have to set aside their differences to make sure that their metropolis survives. How is this any different in the real human world today? One can take many approaches to this issue such as Republicans and Democrats working together, high-income citizens cooperating and working with low-income citizens, black and white Americans working together, and many other real life scenarios that cause conflict in the world. This issue between Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps teaches us that we have a choice to who we are and we can put aside our differences and work together harmoniously. A particular point in the film that demonstrated the stroke of genius from the directors is the incorporation of the DMV run by sloths. It is common knowledge that sloths are some of the slowest moving creatures on earth, and the DMV is one of the most frustrating government agencies because of their slothful nature in dealing with customers. This hilarious and outrageous portrayal in which officer Hopps has to struggle with a sluggish sloth when she is in a hurry to get pertinent information dealing with her case gives a classic representation of real world frustration that many have undergone. The simple yet complex features throughout the movie provide a stimulating and relatable story. As the movie progresses, an underlying issue is finally revealed that will shock the audience. The issue brought to light is that sometimes the real threat to an individual or society is not the predator in the relationship, but the conniving prey. The movie teaches us that we need to put our prejudices aside so we can make correct decisions based on actual evidence, rather than viewing things through biased lenses. This is a powerful message that is placed in the movie that demonstrates the calamity in the world, especially in the United States, because of previous historical issues that will not be put to rest. Directors Bryon Howard, Richard Moore, and Jared Bush put their minds together to create a unique reality in which animals endure the same small and large concerns that humans do. Some of which include dirty politics, racism, and the struggle to live harmoniously with people of all backgrounds. This fascinating parallel between skin color and animal variety shares a beautiful angle on the diversity of the world. With their creative perspective, the directors flawlessly incorporated other iconic films into Zootopia such as ""The Godfather"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", and many other classic films. This tasteful placement of themes of iconic films adds a subtle complexity that made the movie enjoyable to all age ranges. Walt Disney productions over the past few years have been impeccable, including Big Hero Six, Tangled, and the widely popular Frozen. Individuals that have seen these films understand the amazing results that all these movies have achieved, but many would conclude that they have reached the peak of their performance. These conclusions couldn't be more wrong because Zootopia is Disney's true masterpiece.

4.0,2017-07-05,"I can think of no other film that is as timely as this one. Though it's a typical Disney film in structure, the entire film is an overt allegory for racism... and how we each can do our part to overcome prejudice and adversity in society. The protagonist is little Judy Hopps, who aspires to become a police officer despite her diminutive bunny stature and country-bumpkin background. Judy is a great protagonist and worthy role model for little girls, or anybody really. The weird thing about her, and what makes this movie so different, is that she's a racist. She doesn't want to be, and tries very hard not to be, and the story follows her as she begins to realize her prejudices and works to overcome them. The overall message of inclusion and celebrating diversity is a timely and important one, and one that has never been so fully expressed in a children's film. The movie touches on some pretty sensitive racial and gender stereotypes, including some not-so-disguised Islamophobia. I said to myself ""Damn, I can't believe they went there"" more than once. So yeah, it does get a little heavy for a Disney film, but there is enough humor and action mixed in to lighten up the subject matter. Though the movie is clever, the writing is not inherently all that funny... most of the credit for the film's humor is due to the excellent work by the voice actors. Their delivery is really spot on and made me laugh out loud, notably Jason Bateman and Idris Elba (who I am really loving as a voice actor!!).

5.0,2017-06-23,"In 2016, a year when it was still thought that there was far more acceptance than hate, Zootopia brilliantly put together a piece of animation that shows an animal world not all that different from our own, complete with the social issues, granted between former predators and prey, as opposed to our problems of skin color and religion. The best way to see this world was through the hopeful eyes of Judy Hops, and her belief that she could change the world, and that Zootopia was this amazing, perfect place. Drop in a con artist sidekick, and you've got the levity to her unwavering perkiness. The message stays out there through the entire film, as Judy's hopefulness and country naivete are integral to the proper development of the story. It's all fine and well for a while, even despite a sarcastic back and forth relationship between Judy and the Fox, Nick, who eventually grows on her and the audience as we learn more about him, and as the experience of his adventure changes him. The movie zips by, has plenty of nuggets for the adults, and a number of fun moments to entertain the littlest of kids. We can see our reflections in this movie, and it hopes to show us that we're not all that different, and that we should have hope to get along.

4.0,2017-06-14,"""Anyone can be anything."" Zootopia is an incredibly fun and entertaining film from Walt Disney Animation. The story follows a rookie police bunny who teams up with a street hustler fox to track down a missing otter, and together they end up uncovering a dark conspiracy. Starring Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, and J.K. Simmons, the voice cast is especially good and gives some great performances; creating really colorful characters. And the animators do a great job at creating interesting character designs for dozens of different kinds of animals.

What it boils down to is a hyper feminized post modern diatribe against the constructs of a society where biology exists and social commentary stooped in truth.

4.5,2017-04-10,"Zootopia (2016) - Has made a huge impact on a lot of people and at first I never understood why. I never thought the movie was going to be bad but I just didn't think that this would be the next big thing for Disney especially after their amazing lineup of films like ""Tangled"" and ""Big Hero 6"". However, when I finally saw the movie I was completely blown away and now I see why everyone loves this film so much. There were two things that stood out to me, one of them was the chemistry between Judy and Nick. They are probably one of the most irresistible Disney pairings since Rapunzel and Flynn Rider. I really loved the way they work off of each other as well as warming up to share their feelings. The other thing I loved is the way they establish the city of Zootopia itself. Through a clever use of imagery we see how Predators and Prey became what they are today. We also see the many districts that Zootopia has to offer and they take full advantage of showing of each and every one of them and how unique they are. The other part of the story includes a mystery that our heroes have to crack. The mystery only keeps getting bigger and bigger as the movie plays on and the places they visit all have a critical importance into bringing our characters closer to the final reveal. The side characters they meet along the way all have their memorable moments and some of them play important roles into cracking the case. The big thing that caught many people's attention was the morals of Racism and discrimination against others. It does go pretty deep when telling those messages and hits a homerun for a lot of people. I think the way they use Predator and Prey to teach that moral is genius and leads to a lot of heartfelt moments that did make me feel emotional from time to time. The animation is mind blowing and they capture the feeling of being in a big city while also adding features like size and scope to make Zootopia feel so universal to any size of mammal. The characters also look very Disney and it's very cool how each one of them is accurately sized like their real life counterparts. The music was done by Michael Giacchino. You may recognize him as the composer for many Pixar films like ""Ratatouille"" and ""Inside out"". The music features a lot of electric guitar beats and bass strums which really help embrace the feeling of big city life. Theres also a featured pop song by Shakira called ""Try Everything"" and it plays itself out as an inspirational song that really does fit the movie's theme and everything it stands for. My only nitpick would have to be the pace of the third act. It doesn't ruin anything and it's done great in terms of the story, but I felt like after coming off everything that happened in the 2nd act, it just felt a little off when things start to come back to together. Overall, I was surprised by this movie and it's probably one of the best that Disney has to offer.

5.0,2017-03-24,"Zootopia is an excellent Disney movie. So excellent that I am so tempted to watch it a 2nd time. And surprisingly, due to its very complex and adult-themed narrative, younger children might be actually bored with it (the young children at my showing was pretty restless!!) It is directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore (both respectively directed Tangled and Wreck-It-Ralph; both are excellent Disney movies in their own right!). It stars Ginnifer Goodwin as the voice of an optimistic,energetic,lovable female bunny, Judy Hopps; and Jason Bateman as a street-smart fox named Nick Wilde. It is a buddy-cop/thriller dramedy; which is very unusual and groundbreaking for a Disney movie! It has excellent graphics and cinematography; with bright colour palettes. The movie's setting is in a world where humans never existed; and the animals evolved so much that they are now living as humans with modern tech, wearing clothes, and both predator and prey species live in harmony (supposedly). Judy is a cop bunny; the first of its kind. Looked down by other cops due to her species & gender, she became embroiled in a missing persons mystery in which a dozen mammals have gone missing without a trace. In her journey to find the culprit/villain; she seeks the help of Nick, a con-fox. Some of the animals still exhibit some animal habits; with Judy twitching his nose when in fear, which is clever aspect and interesting. This movie's plot touches on the central theme of empowerment, gender discrimination,racism,drug, friendship, and self-worth. Zootopia manage to expertly balance comedy with drama. There are many laugh-out moments in this movie which keep me in stitches; especially the Godfather & giant monster parodies; and any scenes involving slothes. Yet the plot is also mysterious (whodunit), with satisfying twists and horrifying scenes; and with a satisfying villain-reveal and finale. There was a never dull moment in this movie.

4.5,2017-03-03,"Zootopia: Bunny Cop to the Rescue Zootopia: Disney's best animated movie of 2016 is full of cheerful, courageous, and slightly disapproving characters who take you on a remarkable journey to save their beloved city, Zootopia. Early in the movie when Judy is seeing Zootopia for the first time you get an impression of what Zootopia really is. A city where racism does not exist and where diversity is accepted. Zootopia is the place where both predators and prey have evolved past their natural desire to kill each other and live in grace. Its charm results from the spectacular animation and witty script. Judy Hopps (perfectly voiced by Gennifer Goodwin) is a bunny who has her mind set on becoming the first female cop and move to the big city of Zootopia where she presumes to be just like the big city cops. Judy, who lives in a farm with her 275 brothers and sisters, gets no support from her parents who want her to stay and help build their business, but Judy, listening to her heart, follows her dreams. She goes through strenuous training and her hard work pays off because she finishes top of her class and she quickly decides to put her skills to good use and moves to the big city of Zootopia. She is immediately struck with the brutal truth of adult life where she has a depressing apartment. Judy reports to work and quickly becomes frustrated. No one takes her seriously because she is a tiny bunny. On her very first day she is assigned traffic duty. Her boss, Chief Bogo (Idris Elba) clearly has no faith in her and even shows signs of regrets when it came to hiring a female bunny. However that doesn't stop Judy Hopps. This film demonstrates that even when the world wants you to fail, if you believe in yourself you can achieve anything. This is why Zootopia is one of the best Disney movies ever made. When Judy is finally presented with a real case she has to uncover the truth behind the mysterious disappearance of mammals all over the city. She only has one clue though, a cunning fox named Nick (voice of Jason Bateman). The two set out on a wild, bizarre, dangerous mission to find out what is happening to the mammals of Zootopia. The film nailed the chemistry between Judy and Nick specifically when they find themselves in danger when they search for a paranoid and ominous panther named Mr. Manchas (voice by Jesse Corti). You just know that even when the movie takes some dark turns, nothing will separate the two. Zootopia demonstrates the values of true friendship and what teamwork can accomplish, as well as displaying what courage, faith, and commitment accomplish if you never give up. Furthermore, there is no targeted audience with this film because anyone at any age could benefit from watching a movie like this. The length of the movie is long enough to include all the details necessary and not leave people baffled because of unanswered questions. Another strong aspect of the film was the incredibly talented animation which included a touch of realism throughout the whole film and it did not go unnoticed since it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. It's very much demonstrated with the features of the city and with the many different animal species, particularly when Judy was saying goodbye to her family and we get a glimpse of all of her siblings. Zootopia may not have the single alongs that Frozen has, but it's clever enough to catch your attention when personal resilience is so well demonstrated and captures your emotions so well. It conveys a message that are rarely seen in movies for children:Success is no accident. It's hard work, studying, learning, sacrifice and love for what you are doing.",642,en,zootopia bunny cop rescue zootopia disney best animated movie full cheerful courageous slightly disapproving character take remarkable journey save beloved city zootopia early movie judy seeing zootopia first time get impression zootopia really city racism exist diversity accepted zootopia place predator prey evolved past natural desire kill live grace charm result spectacular animation witty script judy hopps perfectly voiced gennifer goodwin bunny mind set becoming first female cop move big city zootopia presumes like big city cop judy life farm brother sister get support parent want stay help build business judy listening heart follows dream go strenuous training hard work pay finish top class quickly decides put skill good use move big city zootopia immediately struck brutal truth adult life depressing apartment judy report work quickly becomes frustrated one take seriously tiny bunny first day assigned traffic duty bos chief bogo idris elba clearly faith even show sign regret came hiring female bunny however stop judy hopps film demonstrates even world want fail believe achieve anything zootopia one best disney movie ever made judy finally presented real case uncover truth behind mysterious disappearance mammal city one clue though cunning fox named nick voice jason bateman two set wild bizarre dangerous mission find happening mammal zootopia film nailed chemistry judy nick specifically find danger search paranoid ominous panther named mr manchas voice jesse corti know even movie take dark turn nothing separate two zootopia demonstrates value true friendship teamwork accomplish well displaying courage faith commitment accomplish never give furthermore targeted audience film anyone age could benefit watching movie like length movie long enough include detail necessary leave people baffled unanswered question another strong aspect film incredibly talented animation included touch realism throughout whole film go unnoticed since academy award best animated feature much demonstrated feature city many different animal specie particularly judy saying goodbye family get glimpse sibling zootopia may single alongs frozen clever enough catch attention personal resilience well demonstrated capture emotion well conveys message rarely seen movie child success accident hard work studying learning sacrifice love,2017-03,337

3.0,2017-02-10,"Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin lend their voices in Disney's Zootopia. Zootopia is an area where all animals are able to live together in harmony. Goodwin is Judy Hoops, a young rabbit that has aspirations to be a cop. She is of course ridiculed as rabbits are typical farmers that are not aggressive. She aims high and graduates from school only to become stereotyped again by her Water buffalo boss (Idris Elba) who makes her become a meter maid. To demonstrate that she can offer more to the force, she takes on a missing otter case and agrees to solve the case within 48 hours or quit. With few leads and evidence, she has no choice but to have a cunning fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) help her even though foxes are known for being mischievous and untrustworthy. As she investigates the case, she finds there is a strange occurrence where historical predators are becoming savage again. The She adds this mystery to the case and hopes to return Zootopia and make it safe for all animals again. Zootopia is above average animated film. The film offers enough humor for adults and the animation will likely dazzle young audiences alike. Many jokes rely on animals being stereotyped such as sloths for being slow and foxes being cunning. Bateman does a good job providing his sense of humor that will be appreciated by fans of his. Puns such as we need to address the elephant in the room, and there being a literal elephant in the room are also scattered throughout the film. Various films such as the Godfather are also parodied. The film does not have as clever or an original premise such as some of the other Pixar films. The concept of a bunch of different animals together seemed all too similar to the many Madagascar films made. As with many Disney films there is an overall good message to leave with the audience, and this one is to always believe in yourself and dreams, and to not judge a book (or an animal) by its cover. The film is well animated, but does not dazzle or leave one in awe. Although there is nothing particularly wrong or glaring with Zootopia, in the sea of animated films that are becoming more and more popular, Disney's Zootopia does not stand out as much as I had hoped. The film is a general crowd pleaser that does not take much risk and simply tries to entertain and that's not always a bad thing. -2.9.2017",423,en,jason bateman ginnifer goodwin lend voice disney zootopia zootopia area animal able live together harmony goodwin judy hoop young rabbit aspiration cop course ridiculed rabbit typical farmer aggressive aim high graduate school become stereotyped water buffalo bos idris elba make become meter maid demonstrate offer force take missing otter case agrees solve case within hour quit lead evidence choice cunning fox nick wilde jason bateman help even though fox known mischievous untrustworthy investigates case find strange occurrence historical predator becoming savage add mystery case hope return zootopia make safe animal zootopia average animated film film offer enough humor adult animation likely dazzle young audience alike many joke rely animal stereotyped sloth slow fox cunning bateman good job providing sense humor appreciated fan pun need address elephant room literal elephant room also scattered throughout film various film godfather also parodied film clever original premise pixar film concept bunch different animal together seemed similar many madagascar film made many disney film overall good message leave audience one always believe dream judge book animal cover film well animated dazzle leave one awe although nothing particularly wrong glaring zootopia sea animated film becoming popular disney zootopia stand much hoped film general crowd pleaser take much risk simply try entertain always bad thing,2017-02,208

Their gorgeous animation and visual inventiveness, not to mention their desire to make us all feel warm and fuzzy, is always something to admire.

It looks excellent, but in this day and age and with the kind of talent and computing power Disney possesses, there's absolutely no excuse for their films to look poor. I did enjoy it for the most part, but there was the unescapable feeling that I'd seen it before, it's very brave for the issues of stereotyping and prejudice that it addresses, and proves that a company making film predominantly for children isn't afraid to also tackle adult issues.

The prey is in the majority, but the predators are in charge of (most of) the police and government. Both the prey and predators suffer from prejudice of different types, and then it gets more complicated when you break the prey and predator groups into types of animals and the stereotypes about them.

Zootopia is going to smash the holiday box office open as it is intelligent and fun the whole way through. The big thing to consider for this movie is whether it is suitable for young children. I had already read some reviews that were saying 5 and 6 years olds may find some scenes scary. And that could be true. I didn't think the boo scenes were that startling, there is really only one jump moment in the whole thing that made everyone leap out of their seats. The part I found most intense was the language. It is not swearing but the characters are rather forceful with their words. If you are uncomfortable with characters aggressively scratching or pushing each other while they say things like ""you jerk, shut up"", then this movie may be too old for your child. The one thing I can say without reserve is that all adults should go see it. You will love it.",186,en,zootopia review wonderfully delightful movie best character seen movie funny sloth hilarious zootopia going smash holiday box office open intelligent fun whole way big thing consider movie whether suitable young child already read review saying year old may find scene scary could true think boo scene startling really one jump moment whole thing made everyone leap seat part found intense language swearing character rather forceful word uncomfortable character aggressively scratching pushing say thing like jerk shut movie may old child one thing say without reserve adult go see love,2016-12,89

4.5,2016-12-15,"To begin with, my opinion on Disney's Zootopia is that it is a nicely animated and a fun to watch movie. Zootopia is based in a big city called Zootopia. Zootopia is full of a lot of different species who live all together in harmony. The characters in Zootopia are very likeable, fun, and entertaining in my opinion. The story is about a bunny named Judy Hopps which is voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin. Judy Hopps wants to be a cop so she graduates from a police academy to fulfil that dream. The rabbit, Judy, is the first of her species to become a cop so she is assigned to an embarrassing parking detail. She eventually gives in on a case to find a missing otter, and gets help from a sly fox of the name of Nick Wilde by blackmailing. Nick Wilde is voiced by Jason Bateman. I feel as if the lesson learned from watching this Zootopia is how discrimination tears everyone apart and does not help anything. The voice acting, lip syncing, etc are very convincing. I like how the fox and the bunny's relationship starts out bumpy and then turns into a friendship. I like how determined and motivated the bunny is when it comes to following her dreams. In conclusion, Zootopia is a family friendly movie that teaches good morals and combats discrimination. Overall, I found this movie very pleasant to watch. I highly recommend to anyone to watch this film. I give Zootopia a fresh tomato as the final verdict.",255,en,begin opinion disney zootopia nicely animated fun watch movie zootopia based big city called zootopia zootopia full lot different specie live together harmony character zootopia likeable fun entertaining opinion story bunny named judy hopps voiced ginnifer goodwin judy hopps want cop graduate police academy fulfil dream rabbit judy first specie become cop assigned embarrassing parking detail eventually give case find missing otter get help sly fox name nick wilde blackmailing nick wilde voiced jason bateman feel lesson learned watching zootopia discrimination tear everyone apart help anything voice acting lip syncing etc convincing like fox bunny relationship start bumpy turn friendship like determined motivated bunny come following dream conclusion zootopia family friendly movie teach good moral combat discrimination overall found movie pleasant watch highly recommend anyone watch film give zootopia fresh tomato final verdict,2016-12,133

3.5,2016-12-08,"There's been alot of buzz surrounding this movie. All year, in fact. People seem to be attracted to this movie because of it's themes of racism, despite it being a ""family adventure film"". I wonder why that is? Firstly, I find this film to be immensely overrated. It sits on a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and it seems to be that Zootopia is impossible to hate. Admittedly, it is a great children's film and a movie that adults will also enjoy, and critics seem to agree. This does *not* mean, however, it is a perfect or near-perfect movie. The biggest flaw in Zootopia is that it tries to be a family film, with an underlying theme of racism and prejudice beneath the surface. The problem is, the film lacks a sense of subtlety. This means that the film tries to have its carrot and eat it, giving a lack of focus and a less-than-great performance in each of the areas. The film would have gone better if it had a sense of subtlety but prefers to heighten the mystery just enough to go over kids heads. Another animated movie about the personification of animals, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" managed to nail the balance by using the characters and the theme to build off each other The main character's in Zootopia, a rabbit named Judy Hopps and a fox named Nick Wilde, were the only properly fleshed out characters in the movie. While this makes sense for a buddy-cop film (like this movie is, whether you like it or not) it does not work when you are trying to build a universe, which arguably is one of this film's biggest priorities. Though the chemistry (no pun intended) between the protagonists is quite charming, the other characters are animal-themed cardboard cutouts of what you've already seen before. This film could have been more ambitious with its ideas and message, however it chooses to focus on its main priorities, almost like a movie check-list that needs to be completed. The story, like the character's, and unfortunately quite cliched and mediocre, which is a real shame as I find the setting quite interesting and creative. It makes sense that this would be the case, however like the characters, it too would have benefited in being more interesting and ambitious. The progression is just what you'd expect from a film of the buddy-cop variety and the editing is just fine, though the twist at the end, which I'm not going to spoil, can be seen from a mile off. Zootopia is a fine, if conventional, animated movie that unfortunately tries a little too hard to be something it's not. Despite all the criticism's I've given it, it still has all the infectious Disney charm that we've come to know and love. Though the characters and story is somewhat cliched, it is built upon and built upon quite well. Kids are gonna love it anyway and adults will probably still enjoy it.

4.5,2016-11-27,"I may be the last person on the planet to have finally watched Zootopia, Disney's first quarter hit of the year, and I am very glad that I did. I was expecting something cute with the premise of a plucky rabbit (voiced winningly by Ginnfer Goodwin) joining forces with a wily grifter fox (Jason Bateman) in the big animal metropolis, but what I wasn't expecting was a fully thought out and stupendously imaginative world and a message that is just as thought out and pertinent. The anthropomorphic animal land is filled with colorful locations and plenty of amusing characters. It's highly amusing just to sit back and watch. I knew I was in for something radically different and dare I say more ambitious when there was an N-word approximation joke within the first ten minutes. This was not a moving to be taken lying down. My attention was rewarded with an engaging relationship between the two leads, careful plotting, endlessly clever asides without relying upon an inordinate amount of pop-culture references, and ultimately a noble and relevant message about the power of inclusion, tolerance, and rejecting prejudice. The larger metaphor seems slightly muddied by the late reveal of who is behind the conspiracy to make the animals go feral, but I wouldn't say it undercuts the film's power. The characters charmed me and I was happy that each ecosystem factored into the story in fun and interesting ways. There are plenty of payoffs distributed throughout the movie to make it even more rewarding. Zootopia is a funny, entertaining, heartfelt, and immersive movie with great characters and a world I'd like to explore again. Given its billion-dollar success, I imagine a return trip will be in short order and we should all be thankful. Something this spry and creative needs to be appreciated.

4.0,2016-11-25,"Surprisingly political of a children's movie has a bunny rabbit from the country travel to the big city with dreams of being the first bunny on the police force. But once she gets on the force she encounters condescension from her superiors, not really listened to, and is generally seen as a political stunt by the mayor. Our bunny rabbit heroine, who's a not so subtle stand-in for women's rights, then enters a city that is not as terrific as she imagined. She finds stores refusing service to certain species, she finds a city that's segregated by animal types, and general open discrimination and negative views of certain animals (they even talk about certain animals being biologically predisposed to be savages). But that all is the intelligent subtext of a film that on the surface level is funny, populated with charming characters, and a visual delight. Our bunny rabbit heroin, voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin, begins investigating a rash of animals turning savage. She enlists the help of a con man fox, voiced by Jason Bateman, who has a bit of a chip on his shoulder by how most residents of Zootopia view foxes. There are also some very funny voice work by Idris Elba as a police captain, Bonnie Hunt as Goodwin's mother, Tommy Chong as a stoner water buffalo, J.K. Simmons as the mayor, Alan Tudyk as a sketch weasel, and you even get Shakira, Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, and Kristen Bell in bit parts.

Now she is off to Zootopia, a multi-animal society where all animals, predator and prey, live in harmony. Her euphoria and idealism is short-lived, however, as she discovers that prejudice between species still exists, and she even starts to doubt her anti-stereotyping stance. What's more, she's assigned to parking meter duty... Wonderfully original. The idea of animals harmoniously coexisting in one world, and essentially representing characters that humans would usually take, on has been done (Jungle Book, Robin Hood) but to this extent. Some great little in-jokes and use of the different characteristics of the different animals. Nice story too, with some very engaging plots and characters. Some clever pop-cultural references too (eg The Godfather, Breaking Bad). Behind it all is a great anti-prejudice, anti-racism message which is conveyed very effectively. Maybe a little too effectively in that it is laid on a bit thick and comes across as preachy. A bit more subtlety was in order, though, for kids, the target demographic of the movie, the level was probably about right.
