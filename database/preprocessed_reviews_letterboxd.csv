I laughed, I cried, I laughed again.
Zootopia is one of, if not the downright funniest animated movie that I have ever seen, with such a clever, if convenient script and themes that are so relevant for this modern society.
Universally loveable, the ENTIRE family will love this film, from pop culture references to its gorgeous animation.
Oh, and you've not seen anything of the Sloth from the trailer yet!

I was happy to find out that Zootopia was released one month early in Denmark, much less so to realize that I, at first, had a tough time finding a theater showing it in English near me. Thankfully, I was able to find time to see it in English at the CinemaxX in Copenhagen. Zootopia is the 55th Walt Disney Animation Studios-film, and the first since the release of Big Hero 6 in 2014, which I enjoyed very much.

Zootopia is the modern metropolis, populated by all manner of mammals. Everyone has an equal opportunity to better themselves, but most resign themselves to their fates. Rabbits are farmers and a lion is Mayor. For Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), her improbable dreams of becoming a police and making Zootopia safer are laughable to most. Bunnies aren't meant to be cops.

Though it falls into some big cliches, and is very predictable, Zootopia touches on some issues in society that needed to be discussed at this point in time, and it is beautifully animated. The voice talent is all great, and the two lead characters are very likable, though not incredibly memorable. It has some great humor as well, and I can't deny that I had fun with it. Though it may be very formulaic, Zootopia is very fun and it has the balls to address issues that should be addressed and discussed, so I must give it credit for that.

Animation is not a genre and should not be stereotyped as for kids only. Disney's Zootopia cleverly conveys that and more as it goes beyond the usual ""follow your dreams"" by dealing with social issues such as prejudice, discrimination, and stereotypes. The result? A complex mystery film with two unlikely friends learning from life's mistakes as they discover more about society through each other's eyes. Their journey serves as a social commentary on how an individual's worth can be unfairly ignored. They stood up against hasty generalizations and ultimately showed us that there can be unity in diversity.

Relishing a creative sense of imagination visually, ""Zootopia"" creates an appealing animated world (through the Animal Kingdom) that successfully emphasized its message about diversity. Even with its plotting and characterizations it triumphed, featuring mortal enemies as allies and turning seemingly-innocent ones as villains. A bold statement indeed, and it knows how to tinker with it: wrapping it up on a crime/mystery thriller vibe and well-crafted sense of humor. The only problem was its emotional baggage that gets wearily imposed but still, this animated feature rocks.

I really enjoyed Zootopia especially for the dialogues. The storyline is too much a classical one, and Disney is unable to ""let go"" some boring stereotypes in character design (especially regarding gender and body image). It's like you have two different stories: the one told in words, dialogues and relationship between characters, and the ore one told in images and visual representation of each character itself. Overall, it's a funny buddy cop movie with some very good shots.

REALLY pleasantly surprised by this movie! It's so sweet! And I think really good for the little ones; they can take away such great morals from this. Wasn't expecting much after seeing all the posters and trailers (I was mostly like ""Meh"" and ""Why does this have a Dreamworks vibe to it though...hmm"") but wow it's so much more than what they promoted/marketed it to be!

Disney's Zootopia is a real treat. I was incredibly disappointed with Disney's previous movies Frozen and Big Hero 6, they just felt average and they didn't stick with me at all. But that's not the case with Zootopia, this movie was a ton of fun. Disney’s previous two movies used tragedies as important plot points or even as plot devices. Zootopias emotional core is used to show character development and to get its surprisingly mature messages across. The emotion in this movie is effective and never feels forced. Zootopia is a fast, fun, funny, beautiful and mature animated film which is Disney’s best film in years.

From the creators of Tangled, Bolt and Wreck-It Ralph, Disney delivers a vibrant wonderland of anthropomorphic animals in a contemporary style that tackles prejudice, celebrates the differences in everybody and does so with wit and heart.

When a film containing social commentary (obviously, even) could be enjoyable towards many ages without not only avoiding being codescending but also without reducing the themes of that commentary, you know that it does a lot of things right. It's still flawed, though: predictable plotline that had been done a lot of times and could have done more with a more exciting soundtrack, but overall it's still very enjoyable.

Zootopia continues Disney's successful streak of great animated features. It has charming lead characters, gorgeous animation, incredible world-building and some very funny jokes. But the most surprising aspect of the film is its effective exploration of such complex themes like racism and prejudice towards others, without feeling preachy and heavy-handed, and instead is used effectively to drive the story forward. Another win for Disney!

The film's referential nature is something I would expect from Dreamworks but, surprisingly, it works well here. Zootropolis has so much going on but it manages to tie everything together with no difficulty. The film is examines racism in a way that is accessible to kids (I sincerely hope that the younger ones will be able to make the connection). In typical Disney fashion, the film has a lot of heart but is also extremely hilarious. I loved the voice cast, the score, and the overall fun nature of the film. I only wish they'd done away with Gazelle's (Shakira) big number at the end.

Disney's success seems to always be cyclical, for whatever reason, seeing golden eras, then slumps, only to be revived by more golden eras. It could be argued that Disney Animation Studios, after seeing a once such Golden Era in the early 90s with such films as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King, saw itself on the decline in the age of Pixar.

Remember how the trailers for frozen depicted it as a fast paced comedy, but it was really a drama at heart with a comedic tone.
Zootopia's also been depicted as a fast paced comedy (excluding the sloths). But it's really a crime/thriller with a comedic tone. Also it's about how racism, prejudice and bullying is bad. Never give up on your dreams. We are all imperfect, but we should never stop us from trying.

Zootopia follows up the run of Wreck It Ralph and Big Hero 6 so very nicely that one almost forgets the early 2000's Disney slump. Everything about Zootopia runs so smoothly: the cast is excellent and the script is top notch, being both amusing for kids and a bit deeper for adults.

Zootopia did not have any reptiles or apes in it. These are two of my favorite animals. However, I still like Zootopia. This is because it was funny and I learned about racism. It was funny to watch these animals talk about race stereotypes, but it also would teach little kids a lesson I guess.
I appreciated that Zootopia set up a universe with rules that made some sort of logical sense within the movie, and then stuck to those… more

Zootopia is surprisingly complexly plotted for a Disney film, with a missing persons/conspiracy coverup storyline that would work even if it was a straight procedural drama. The humor isn't as prevalent as you would hope, and the movie being so busy it also leaves little room for the emotional core you typical expect from Disney movies as well. Ginnifer Goodwin is Judy Hopps, an ambitious rabbit who's dreams of being a cop, the first of her species, come true, though… more

Zootopia is another success for Disney Animation.
The witty humor, many pop culture references, and humorous plot make for a great experience.
The sloths in the DMV are the best part of the movie and there's even a GREAT Godfather spoof and a Breaking Bad reference.
My only complaint is that the whole ""racism is bad"" theme is kind of shoved down the viewers throat. Racism is bad but the approach could have been taken in a different way.

Zootopia's Wikipedia entry classifies its genre as ""computer-animated action buddy comedy neo-noir adventure"", a mouthful if ever there was one. It has two directors and a ""co-director"", as well as seven credited writers involved in the story (including Jennifer Lee, who is perhaps responsible for the references to Frozen littered throughout), two of whom handle the screenplay. If that sounds like a recipe for a hodgepodge, it's not, as it turns out -- this is terrific stuff.

Mix it in with some top-notch animation, clever humour, and a well-realized world and you've got yourself great movie. Good job, Disney.

One of the most family-friendly animated flicks in recent memory. When I say ""the most family-friendly"", I mean both adults and kids can get equal amount of entertainment and value from it.
Zootopia is social commentary that both adults and kids can pick up on but in their own ways. Themes of inclusion//seclusion, prejudice//racism//sexism, et cetera. Remarkably, it's somehow not preachy. On top of all that the film is also just terrifically animated and hilariously directed and realistically written.
Def worth a watch. Def gonna watch again. Def gonna own one day. Def gonna be the animated film of the year.

""We may be evolved, but deep down we are still animals."" - Mr. Big
Walt Disney Animation Studios' best film in years is a buddy cop film populated with civilized animals. The premise and world are expertly unfolded, setting the stage for a fable about our day and age.

""I'm not just some token bunny,"" the rabbit heroine of Zootopia tells the chief of police, who has assigned her to parking meter duty. The rabbit graduated at the top of her class at the academy, and she is the first rabbit to ever make it on the city of Zootopia's police force. The only thing her animal colleagues notice, though, is her diminutive stature, as well as the fact that she, like all other bunnies, is incredibly cute. ""Cute,""… more

I rate films based on visceral experience, not based on inherent value. This is an excessively charming film, but it raises a lot of questions.
The premise of the film is that animals can all live in harmony. But the utopia that predators and prey create together is astoundingly artificial, and the film only tentatively explores the many seams that seem to make such a society totally untenable.

Disney's ""Fuck you"" to Donald Trump and his supporters.
This is an example of committee filmmaking done absolutely right. Zootopia is stuffed to the brim with visual metaphors, amazingly detailed environments, and beautifully animated characters. The casting is excellent (especially Jason Bateman's fox and J.K. Simmons's lion), the writing is witty. It's a classic approach, using anthropomorphized animals to tell a relevant political parable. It may be wholly unsubtle with its themes, but those themes are as prescient as ever, and sometimes people need messages to be overt in order for them sink in.

After how much I loved ""Kung Fu Panda 3,"" I had a really hard time imagining an animated film topping it for the rest of the year. Then ""Zootopia"" comes in and proves me wrong. This is a movie that transcends just being a relentlessly entertaining animated feature with fun characters and actually provides the audience with some deep themes to discuss that relate to the flawed society we live in. It's a movie that's not afraid to tell it like it is and doesn't sugarcoat the harsh realities of life. You'd never know that just from seeing a trailer of a sloth at the DMV.

""On the animated front, Disney’s Zootopia is reminiscent of hand-drawn studio classics like Robin Hood, The Aristocats or The Rescuers. As far as the narrative side of the equation is concerned, the film plays both like a 1980’s-style buddy comedy like Midnight Run or 48 Hrs. as well as film noir classics like The Big Sleep or Chinatown. It is a deft, hugely enjoyable frolic through a what-if world the likes of which I cannot say I’ve ever seen before, the level of imagination continually on display impressive to say the least.""

Cute, gorgeously animated, and very funny; but it also surprisingly touches on some very adult themes and political issues that are pretty uncommon to hear in children's films.
It's a lot smarter and more ambitious than I was expecting it to be; and some may feel that some of it comes off as too forced, but I mostly found it to be refreshing to see an animated film go for a more adult approach in it's storytelling while still being funny and entertaining from start to finish.
It's a great family movie with great morals, beautiful animation, smart writing, and timely adult themes.

Disney managed to tell a story about following your dreams, the mob, an evil criminal AND made us think about current societal views on race with animated anthropomorphic animals. And they did it in a way that only Disney can: entertaining for both kids and adults.

The only grievance I have with this film is that I can't get that Shakira song out of my head. I will be humming it for weeks.

Always visually interesting, this is a funny, serious, compelling film noir with animals. Amazing how - ever since Aesop's Fables - animals have always been perfect vehicles for depicting human foibles, virtues, and prejudices.

I applaud Disney for making a kids movie with an actual message that I think kids will understand without shoving it down adults' throats. Zootopia's messages are pretty obvious: don't judge people based on prejudice, don't fear someone because they're different, etc. But the message is delivered in a nuanced, mature way that I rarely see in family fare. It's never stated outright, and there's no one character that learns the lesson. Everyone in the movie is wrong, and everyone… more

This film was a great noir, detective/mystery story with all the tropes and twists. And (I guess SPOILER?) it kind of turned into a drug lab bust? I thought Zootopia was wonderful, with all the specialty humor of something like Inside Out, except animal puns and gags instead of emotions and feelings.
I would not be surprised to see Zootopia among the front of the animated pack by the end of the year. What great fun!

Super fun Disney film with a heavier message than usual. Zootopia is probably the cutest film I've seen to tackle racism issues, and though the film ends happily for all involved (this film is a Disney movie after all), the attempt to even take about issues of judging others based solely on where they came from should be respected. The film is ultimately too cute to actually solve and give means of fixing these problems for adults, but if children start learning about the problem and coming up with solutions, then maybe prejudices, in a generation or two, could be a thing of the past.

While all animals co-exist peacefully in Zootopia, race-based prejudices are hard to shake off, especially when shady politicians help them festering to pursue their own agendas. Centered on a bunny's determination to succeed as a police officer, and on her awkward attraction for a confidence fox, ""Zootopia"" is a fun-packed detective story about the dangers stemming from social and racial clichés, showing their ever-increasing power as tools of mass manipulation.

""Ice him!""
Exceptionally well-told and commendable story that confidently juggle its subliminal messages of racial-based stereotypes and discrimination. Extremely in awe with even the tiniest of details of attention being paid onto the world-building of Zootopia itself (The sloths managing the DMVs. The mouse city. But where are the insects though?). Love the hat-tips for the 'Godfather' and 'Breaking Bad' ('Woolter'). And top-notch animation work (the highlight for me being the one where Judy walks into the city center for the first time and it's utterly gorgeous.)
What a pleasant surprise this turned out to be.

With a new Disney renaissance that didn't take a single wrong step yet, Zootopia is more of a small lump. And dare I say, unnecessary.
It is a highly enjoyable film, very well written and one of their funniest films ever. But it's too safe.
The screenplay is very well written but doesn't explore any new territories. The themes are deja vu, and pretty much spoon fed to the viewer.
But as I said, the sense of humor is at its best and it works really well.
And needless to say, the animation is impeccable.
I guess the studio is putting more effort on Moana.

I think a lot of people weren't expecting much from this movie, but as we left the theater, everyone was buzzing and talking about how good the movie was.

Though it has a couple of story problems, it's probably my favorite of the recent run of Disney Animated Films productions.
Fresh, funny, great metaphors that can be applied to race, gender, sex, etc, and a fully developed world and characters that even have SCALE as being part of what makes the city what it is. Plus it's a cop procedural, and a very good one at that (with a few predictable parts, but it's this kind of movie so I can let it pass). Did I mention it's very funny?

Zootopia is a fun, hilarious and really well made animated film that is great for everybody. The voice acting by everyone was amazing and the animation was stunning. I also found myself laughing a lot, this is a funny film. But, I also love how this film has actual substance. This film can connect to modern society issues and I thought that was really well-handled. Zootopia is so much fun and Disney's best animated film since Wreck-It-Ralph.

With its strong message about acceptance, inclusion, anti-bullying, and pursuing your dreams, Disney has made an animated film that is not only fun but says something important. Essentially just an animated buddy cop film, it is full of Disney references and even a hilarious Breaking Bad gag.

A fun time at the movies. Wonderfully creative, funny, and surprisingly ambitious. It takes balls to tackle race, and while the metaphors at play here are a little muddled due to the predator vs. prey thing, the overall message is sound. Looking forward to the next one.

The best thing I can say about this movie is that Walt Disney would have been extremely proud of it. Or maybe not considering the movie's message and his *ahem* bias towards people of the Jewish faith.
In normal circumstances, I'd say that this is the best animated movie I've seen since, I don't know, TOY STORY 3, but these aren't normal circumstances. Pixar changed the game 8 or so months ago, so ZOOTOPIA will have to take the silver this time.
I'd be shocked if this doesn't make my end-of-the-year favorites list.

*FANTABULOUS*
Oh my word. If Disney's animated flicks get any better than they already are, the universe will probably unmake itself in confusion. 'Zootopia' is literally one of the most inspiring films I've ever seen in the theatre, and is already going to be one of the top ten of the year. Wall-to-wall laugh-out-loud humor (including a delicious Godfather spoof) is matched by great characters, a stellar plot, and wonderful, subtle messages. Truly fantabulous. Skip over pretty much everything else in the box office and go see this.

Zootopia has a dumb, simplistic premise that I found really hard to get excited about before it came out.

Possibly one of the best Disney characters in recent ages. Judy is just incredible as a character and Ginnifer Goodwin fully realizes her. Jason Bateman's character falls a bit flat unfortunately, and I think that's where my problems lie. While I really loved the overall story, I never found myself emotionally connected to it.
On the technical side, the advances in animation never cease to amaze me. This seriously is a gorgeous film. Just stunning.

As far as animated animal-based racial parables go, this ain't half bad. It doesn't have the most nuanced insight in the world (and a few too many stereotype-based jokes make the commentary a bit hard to take seriously), but the characters are entertaining and the world-building is so detailed and clever that it's hard to mind.
Question, though: What do predators eat in this universe?

Much, MUCH better than I expected. Honestly, the marketing does this movie a complete disservice. Instead of the kid-focused, gag-driven movie the trailers try to sell, this is instead a smart and timely movie with a strong (and much-needed) message played out in a fun homage to crime movies.
Ample humor, creative world building, a pretty stacked voice cast, excellent animation, and a genuinely interesting (albeit predictable) story. Strongly recommended to kids and adults alike.

REVIEW WORK IN PROGRESS
Zootopia (or Zootropolis in other countries) is the return of all Disney glory.
Set in a world of anthropomorphic animals, Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) dreams of becoming the first rabbit police officer in the colorful titular city. Her dream later becomes reality, but realizes that being on a police force of big tough animals isn't easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a missing mammal case. Unfortunately, that means she has to partner with Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman), a con artist fox to help solve the case.

Zootopia is clever, witty, charming, funny and very entertaining. This is without a doubt one the best animated films in recent memory and it might just be my favorite. While I love The Lego Movie, I'm debating if I liked Zootopia even more and that's saying something. The voice cast was excellent, the animation was gorgeous, and it's not afraid to tackle some important themes. I went into this expecting to like it but I did not expect to love it this much.

Zootopia is saved by the movie surrounding its message. Within each gorgeous, detail-packed, vibrant frame is a gateway to a whole new idea and subtle visual touch. I was left breathless by the colors and the boundaries that Disney Animation Studios continue to explore, building a fast and fun Noir yarn around a world just as dense and cluttered (but never overly busy). It's like a mini-Inherent Vice in how it dives into a gradual crime case while simultaneously… more

So I watched Hot Fuzz again...
Wait, this isn't Hot Fuzz.
Then what am I doing here?
Oh yeah, this one. This one's pretty good too. And by pretty good I mean shockingly great. I'd say it's my favorite film of the year so far if it wasn't the only movie from this year I've seen. 😕
I feel like I should also note this is easily Disney's best film of this era, save for maybe Wreck-it-Ralph.

The plot is nothing new, and to a certain extent, neither are the characters. But the writing is very original and lends itself to some good social commentary that doesn't get too preachy. At least for the most part. This movie does what a lot of good animated movies do, and creates a world that is interesting and open to A LOT of visual gags. All this being said, I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of animated movies.

It takes years, even as long as a decade, to develop an animated feature. That's what makes the incredible timeliness of the sub-text in Zootopia amazing. Chronicling the journey of Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), Zootopia PD's first rabbit officer and Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a con-man with surprising depth, the film deftly addresses the issues of prejudice, inclusion, diversity and stereotyping in a way that most serious films could not.

With humor abounding both in its witty screenplay and visual gags, Disney's 'Zootopia' is an incredibly entertaining piece of animation filmmaking that is visually stunning from start to finish.
Story-wise I felt the film lose a lot of steam about 3/4 of the way through and therefore fail to make the perfect landing that makes some of Disney's previous hits genuine classics.

Due to the delay of Pixar's The Good Dinosaur, the latest Walt Disney Animation Studios picture was delayed to 2016. Much like Wreck-It Ralph and Big Hero 6, Zootopia set itself apart with a unique premise, and attracted much anticipation as all Disney animated films do. Thankfully, while it's arguably still not up to Pixar's impeccably high standard, Zootopia is quite possibly the best Walt Disney Animation Studios picture in recent memory.
Full review at my blog.

The fact that 'Zootopia' is yet another well-animated, well-voice acted, and all-around fun Disney animated film would easily make it a highly recommended film worth checking out just on that idea alone. But then you factor in the film's strongly-written story that combats racism and bigotry in a way that we can all take note from and you have what is quite frankly one of the studio's all-time best efforts.

The animals in Zootopia come across largely as well-formed characters, which is a huge achievement. By tackling the idea of animal stereotypes head on, we get a little peek into how complicated those behavioral short-cuts can be.
There is more than a little reliance on the classic tropes for sake of jokes, thought. The population of the bunny town is shown on a sign with the numbers going up by the second, etc. But by and large, pre-judgements are called into question at every turn.
Very enjoyable. And even better, very light on dumb humor.

The only reason that this isn't 5 stars is because, while I really enjoyed it, I don't feel particularly passionate about it. I think it's a very important movie for Disney to make, and I'm glad to see the reception it's getting (and absolutely deserves), but when the credits hit I didn't find myself going ""oh my god oh my god oh my god"". There really weren't any moments in it that made me feel that way.

That said, this movie is fucking solid. There's nothing I didn't like. For real.

Disney did not disappoint with this film. It left me thinking about how we treat each other based on our biases and our own ignorance. It rare to find a film that tackles so many topics ranging from following your dreams, we shouldn't judge people based on how you believe they would act and understanding that people can change and grow from past experiences. Just to name a few.
I hate spoilers, so I won't mention any of the wonderful jokes from the film.

Underneath the familiar buddy cop story and predictable mystery is an impressively deft commentary on race. And beyond that, is an even subtler commentary on gender. It's great to see a Disney heroine who doesn't need romance, who excels in a male-dominated police force, and who demonstrates the reward of hard work and hope.
The main characters are fun to watch, there are some fun gags with the world, and the final act is handled really well. I'd recommend it.

Animals in stories can sometimes be funny animals, and sometimes allegorical animals. Zootopia tries to combines the two. The movie wears its heart on its sleeve, but never comes across as preachy. The sloth scene will be a classic and the site gags of animals living in varying scales are clever. But, for what the film is trying to say, the humor could have used more bite and more surprise. And, please, as I beg of all children's movies, a few less cliched action set-pieces, please.

I went to see this movie with my niece and nephew, thinking it would be a fun family film but not much more. Boy, was I wrong. This is a film that probably wouldn't be very appreciated by a large part of the adult population who don't want their racist, sexist or otherwise problematic behaviour to be criticized by a kids' film.

The coolest part and biggest surprise about ""Zootopia"", at least for me, was that it's really that classic 'cop teams up with criminal with good heart to catch greater evil' story we've seen so many times, disguised as a harmless kids flick that's thankfully made largely accessible enough to both adults and kids.
Some genuinely funny writing, all around great voice acting and wonderful inventiveness in storytelling makes ""Zootopia"" one of the better, clever, and smarter films from Disney animation in a while.

Even if it doesn't always work and it may not stay perfectly logical, an animation film going for such deeply thematic and topical material has to be applauded and appreciated. So much of this works and makes a great point about social injustices and biases that we all can take away a lot of from it. There is still a lot of humor and lovely animation to boost, and even if it relies on a few too many pop culture references it still works way more often than not.

In Zootopia they mention praying and at one point show a polar bear doing the sign of the cross... So I have to wonder, who is the Animal Jesus? Was he also crucified for the animals' sins? Would he look down on the main characters loving different species? If so, can Animal Jesus be the unnecessary antagonist in the sequel?

Don't believe the reviews, this is not on par with Pixar at all. It is at times a little bit daring, but is full of tropes, obvious jokes, and lazy plot points. Seriously, you can't plant something three minutes before it pays off. The six-year old next to us was able to predict the ending. On the bright side, the animation is rather stunning.

The amazing thoughtful imagination of our real society resembled in the animal kingdom world.
The plot was great. Even the twist and the whole redlining from beginning to the end.
Sadly, I have no favorite scenes.
The whole Zootopia was so amazing but sadly, they never really gave us a real out from the train-tour track, like in Jurassic Park, and we never really know what's exactly the world of Zootopia?
Sad...sadly for me, the movie has so much potential but it just gave us the point of society problem metaphor which the great twist turned to be cliche.

Easily the best animated Disney movie in several years. It's got wonderful characters that are funny, endearing, and flawed. This is a movie about learning to understand and accept the differences and faults in one another, and how the inability to do that can cause problems not only on a personal level, but on a societal level as well. The social commentary is thinly veiled, but has the perfect amount of transparency for kids to understand that the ideas of… more

I went into Zootopia with expectations that I was almost 100% certain would end up being correct. As usual, because I'm such an absolute genius, they were correct.
The movie was wonderfully animated, the ""animal stuff"" was clever, the dialogue was on-the-nose, and it was just all-around cute.
I laughed out loud many times throughout the movie, and think it succeeded on many levels.
What I didn't expect, however, was for the movie to be so political. Granted, it was political in a very obvious way, almost too much for my taste, but I suppose it's a kid's movie and that's the point.

After the massive success and intellectual grandeur of Inside Out last year, I figured it would be a very long time before any other animated film came close. Inside Out tackled our views on cognition and emotion in a beautifully creative way, making it not only a spectacle to watch but also somewhat of a crash course in Freudian psychology. In many ways, Zootopia is also an incredibly intelligent and creative film, though its purpose is for a different message—an… more

Very pretty and pretty formulaic. The gags land solidly well more than 50% of the time but the movie gets a little too bogged down in the tried and true narrative conventions of the detective genre to rise above in a crowded field of Pixar masterpieces.

Jason Bateman also feels miscast here. He just doesn't bring enough energy into his fox role - this could've been a much more wily, unpredictable character and a little more spark in the vocal performance alone would've gone a long way. He could be a little more animated. Get it? Get it?? Get... get me a gun, I'm done here.

Disney Animation continues to knock it outta the park. Zootopia kept a smile on my face for almost the entirety of its runtime. The characters are heartfelt and draw the audience in.
Jason Batemen as the sly fox is perfectly voiced and equally matched by Ginnifer Godwin who plays Judy Hopps. The ensemble cast also stand out especially Idris Elba and JK Simmons.
It's worth noting that Shakira is also in the film and is probably the most unnecessary character… more

By far the best of Disney's recent animated features. This film tackles ideas of racism, gender discrimination, and intersectionality through anthropomorphic animals, which have been generally taken for granted as a concept in cartoons over the last century. Zootopia leans into the whole phrenology aspect of anthropomorphism, challenging assumptions based on species in a way that very intentionally recalls human bigotry. The idea of a ""sly fox"" is very old and heavily-rooted in folklore, so to see it challenged like… more

It would be so much more successful if it wasn't so by the book, or straddled with an unfortunately mixed message, but it's still a very funny and clever film. The form it assumes as a comical conspiracy thriller is neat and slightly fresh, and the world building at hand here is absolutely killer. Filled with great characters… more

This movie was absolutely adorable and funny coming from someone far off the ""target audience"" (debatable cause there were moments for everyone). The movie also includes a very important message about acceptance and stereotyping that is hidden (but not so hidden) in the alternate reality of Zootopia

An absolute blast to watch, with a surprisingly pointed social commentary advocating for a message of tolerance that rings loudly over the 1hr48 run time of this crowd-pleaser.
I have heard arguments about the movie's muddled metaphor, but I would argue that the film's complexity is what sells it. Never relegating minorities to simple black or white, never painting it's heroes or villains in plain colors.

For a company who was founded on animals behaving like people, Zootopia is a surprisingly rare offering by Disney where every single character in the film is non-human -- and more importantly, not a princess! Sure Zootopia is a great animated feature, but its bold underlying message about stereotyping, discrimination and racism is what makes Zootopia so much more than just a cheery little movie about animals. I don't know if an animated movie has ever felt more timely than this one and you can't help but hope that the themes presented here will resonate with kids beyond the theater.

No Pixar or Disney movie from the last 10 years combined could be as good or as important as Zootopia. Because it's about being anything you want to be, because it's about race and acceptance, because it's what kids need to hear and what adults need to learn. Because it's kind of like a Coen Brothers movie! Because it's gorgeous and hilarious and critical for the time we're living in.

""The more that I reflect on my experience with this film, the better I feel about it. Few big-budget animated productions have the audacity to have so much action, humor and juvenile antics mix harmoniously with mature themes. However, that attempt to combine all of these things works wonderfully in Zootopia. For that reason, I wouldn’t be surprised if this eventually ends up being one of my favorite films of 2016. Any animated film that makes me laugh, well up with emotions, affect my treatment of others, sigh about adulthood and broaden my perspective on society deserves my unequivocal approval.""

Well-animated and thoroughly engaging. It serves as a solid racism allegory for kids, and I particularly appreciate how it highlights the ability of a demagogue to exploit racial tensions to further his/her own aims. Digging too deeply reveals flaws in the allegory, but I'm not sure it's important for it to be flawless for its target demographic to learn something. It does have a more serious flaw, in that the writers seem to hit a wall about two thirds of the way through the film, and requires a development to come out of nowhere in order to get it moving forwards again.

ZOOTOPIA surprises. I expected a moving drama about the extraordinary lives of ordinary folks. Instead, I got a dark police procedural that says a lot of progressive things about prejudice. The politics really *are* centerpiece here, with every other scene recalling contemporary discussions about race, crime, poverty, and even biology. You can't overstate how unusual this is; the last mainstream animation to be so patently political was 1973's ROBIN HOOD.

Although Devin Faraci's review oversimplifies some aspects of the film and overemphasizes others, I, for the most part, agree with his assessment: ZOOTOPIA bites off a bit more than it can chew, metaphorically and allegorically, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a) visually intriguing, b) filled with interesting characters, and c) a fun cop movie that is almost certainly lost on children.
Of note: I never thought I'd be agreeing to such a large extent with Mr Faraci.

With plenty of humor and parody to go around, Zootopia manages a pretty steady laugh stream throughout while also managing to keep up a fairly engaging plot (especially for a Disney movie). Plus, the movie is equal parts buddy cop and noir movie, an interesting pairing that surprisingly works in this context. Additionally, Zootopia packs some punch with some beautifully interwoven narrative on racial and… more

This is French Connection meets Taxi with a slight stop at a Quarantine type horror movie done by Walt Disney (Feature) Animation. On paper it may sound like a weird combo but, but Zootopia is able to make it work. It is a much more light-hearted movie than the last two Disney Animated movies (Frozen and Big Hero 6.) Zootopia is a great action comedy cop-drama and I dare say is more for adults with these in-jokes than the kids. For where this movie ranks, it is nearly as good as Big Hero 6 but is better than Frozen.

There's a little too much going on in Zootopia for it to have the thematic weight it's clearly aiming for and it relies too much on cheap gags at times, but with world-building this intricate and a set of characters this charming, it's pretty hard not to enjoy it.

A rabbit achieves her dream of becoming a police officer and teams up with a petty criminal fox to find a missing otter. Heavy-handed, protracted metaphor about prejudice and tolerance; certainly a timely film (unfortunately), but it even undercuts its own intention by populating the movie with stereotypes all over the place. The animation is cool, however, and the voice performances -- particularly Jason Bateman as the fox -- are wonderful.

Zootopia is an interesting film in a few different ways. It explores very adult themes (for a children's film, especially) of human racism, xenophobia, and sexism.
The benefits of this is a richer narrative with a realistic atmosphere. Adults, like myself, in the theater could comprehend the meaning behind statements such as ""bunnies don't become police officers"" and the whole predators vs. prey dynamic.

Okay, to be clear, it's a shame that Disney's marketing team felt the need to insert themselves into this movie so heavily. When they're not busy making their presence known by constantly trying to sell you that terrible new Shakira song, the movie's awesome.
Genuinely, this is the best thing that Disney animation has put out since ""Treasure Planet"", in my opinion. And it's definitely better than anything they've put out in the past few years. It's better than ""Big… more

What at first appears to be a cute funny movie about animals turns into a great message about prejudice and stereotypes. While still fun and comedic, it gets very serious about how society's prejudices and stereotypes affects the oppressed. The film never talks down to the audience and it is something kids and adults should enjoy. All of the voice acting from the actors was fantastic.

Zootopia is a great film for children and adults alike. There were a surprising amount of adult references that kids would not get. Most notably to The Godfather, Breaking Bad, Cheech & Chong, and surely many others. They got the parents in my cinema laughing.
The cast of characters that they assembled are pretty fantastic. Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a ridiculously cute rabbit. I loved her drooping ears, and her voice was perfect. She's super adorable. Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman)… more

There are some parts that are mindblowingly good (the opening ten minutes, the press conference scene), but overall the rest was just average.

Zootopia is the latest animated offering from Disney and it is an extremely fun one. Interesting, funny characters and a fast paced, thrilling storyline which plays out like a great mystery caper.
I think the stand out here though, were definitely the visuals. The actual look of Zootopia and its various sub-sections, such as Sahara Square and the tundra and rainforest areas looked amazing. The amount of detail the animators put into these areas that made them look fully lived in was excellent.
There were so many little sight gags and background jokes going on that this film will definitely warrant repeated viewings.

Loved it, didn't have high expectations and it doesn't match up with the better offerings of Pixar but this was an entertaining, funny and well judged. A good mixture of jokes that play to the young viewers and plenty of jokes for the adults in attendance. Also dealt with issues of exclusion and prejudice about as well as a disney animation could do.
Some very entertaining in jokes, self referential humor and puns, Idris Elba voicing the police captain Bull was a particular highlight.
A genuine pleasant surprise of a film

Disney Animation Studios pull another hit out the bag with the perfect mix of charm, laughs and fun times you expect from them. The chemistry between Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin's characters is fantastic and Bateman as a voice artist is just superb and perfectly suited to his role.
The only issue big issue I have with the movie is cosmetic. Why on earth is it called Zootopia in the American market and Zootropolis over here in Europe? What is… more

Amazing. My second watch and Zootopia was even more enjoyable this time around, featuring fantastic voice-work mixed with wonderful animation. The themes of prejudices and stereotypes are haunting, to say the least, and reflect our world very well. I've never seen a movie bringing up those themes in such a clever way.
The part with the sloths at the DMV has to be the highlight. All funny jokes were shown in the trailers, yet Zootopia surprises with a big heart for its audience. Go Disney!

Every single review I've heard about this film has started, ""Surprisingly, it was....!"" and I have to agree. I had no urge to see this movie when I first saw the trailers, but I ended up getting dragged to the theater by a friend who loved it so much they HAD to see it a second time. And I was surprisingly (and pleasantly) surprised. :) A well made, well paced, beautifully animated kids' movie with remarkably apt allegories for societal power dynamics. I might have even cried during the muzzle scene...
A nice movie all around.

Some of the best character animation I've ever seen. A charming way of teaching a lesson about prejudice—but must ALL kids' movies teach lessons? Particularly when such machinations seem to distract the (7!) writers from creating an organic story not overly beholden to plot mechanics?
Still, there is much to enjoy and admire here. I just wish the economics of such films allowed for greater realism, even in a story about talking animals.

I already know this is a movie I'll be rewatching a few times, not just because it's a great watch, but because of the many great Easter eggs, many of which I'm sure I missed. Lots of jokes for the grown ups to enjoy.
Great story, beautiful animation, a real Disney feel to the whole thing. Lots of laughs and lots of feels. The setting is a little absurd but bring your suspension of disbelief and don't ask too many questions about how all these animals can live in harmony in a seemingly evolved state in a world devoid of humans.

Pixar is not the only studio with a fantastic track record. Walt Disney Animation Studios has been delivering the goods for many years now, from WRECK-IT RALPH to TANGLED to FROZEN to BIG HERO 6. Ever since the studio has been running under the watchful wisdom of Sir John Lasseter, their output has been more satisfying and entertaining than any of their studio counterparts.

A fun, energetic, heartfelt, but somehow quite workmanlike animated film. The direction especially felt like it did not have much flair or character, and the movie's very explicit tackling of heavy topics such as racism and sexism was a welcome surprise but ultimately muddled - the animals of different species metaphor was not very elegantly used to express the different characters of people since biology and DNA were explicitly brought up, for instance. Still, I was pleasantly surprised the humor… more

It's a movie about prejudice, reverse-prejudice, hidden prejudice, preconception, Othering, and privilege, all masqueraded as a talking animals CGI cartoon. Awesome.
Take the American melting pot and conceptions of equality, throw out any reference to race, religion, and gender, and throw in species and predator/prey as classifications, and you have _Zootopia_ ...
... which is _far_ less polemic than that sounds, flowing very naturally as a story about personal gumption, dreams, disappointment, and the complexity of _real life_ ... with… more
